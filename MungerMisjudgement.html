    <h2>The Psychology of Human Misjudgment <small><b>by Charles T. Munger</b></small></h2>
    <p>PREFACE</p>
    <p>When I read transcripts of my psychology talks given about fifteen years
    ago, I realized that I could now create a more logical but much longer
    “talk,” including most of what I had earlier said. But I immediately saw
    four big disadvantages.</p>
    <p>First, the longer “talk,” because it was written out with more logical
    completeness, would be more boring and confusing to many people than any
    earlier talk. This would happen because I would use idiosyncratic
    definitions of psychological tendencies in a manner reminiscent of both
    psychology textbooks and Euclid. And who reads textbooks for fun or
    revisits Euclid?</p>
    <p>Second, because my formal psychological knowledge came only from
    skimming three psychology textbooks about fifteen years ago, I know
    virtually nothing about any academic psychology later developed. Yet, in a
    longer talk containing guesses, I would be criticizing much academic
    psychology. This sort of intrusion into a professional territory by an
    amateur would be sure to be resented by professors who would rejoice in
    finding my errors and might be prompted to respond to my published
    criticism by providing theirs. Why should I care about new criticism? Well,
    who likes new hostility from articulate critics with an information
    advantage?</p>
    <p>Third, a longer version of my ideas would surely draw some disapproval
    from people formerly disposed to like me. Not only would there be stylistic
    and sub-stantive objections, but also there would be perceptions of
    arrogance in an old man who displayed much disregard for conventional
    wisdom while “popping-off” on a subject in which he had never taken a
    course. My old Harvard Law classmate, Ed Rothschild, always called such a
    popping-off “the shoe button complex,” named for the condition of a family
    friend who spoke in oracular style on all subjects after becoming dominant
    in the shoe button business.</p>
    <p>Fourth, I might make a fool of myself. Despite these four very
    considerable objections, I decided to publish the much-expanded version.
    Thus, after many decades in which I have succeeded mostly by restricting
    action to jobs and methods in which I was unlikely to fail, I have now
    chosen a course of action in which (1) I have no significant personal
    benefit to gain, (2) I will surely give some pain to family members and
    friends, and (3) I may make myself ridiculous. Why am I doing this?</p>
    <p>One reason may be that my nature makes me incline toward diagnosing and
    talking about errors in conventional wisdom. And despite years of being
    smoothed out by the hard knocks that were inevitable for one with my
    attitude, I don’t believe life ever knocked all the boy’s brashness out of
    the man.</p>
    <p>A second reason for my decision is my approval of the attitude of
    Diogenes when he asked: “Of what use is a philosopher who never offends
    anybody?”</p>
    <p>My third and final reason is the strongest. I have fallen in love with
    my way of living out psychology because it has been so useful for me. And
    so, before I die, I want to imitate to some extent the bequest practices of
    three characters: the protagonist in John Bunyan’s Pilgrims Progress,
    Benjamin Franklin, and my first employer, Ernest Buffett. Bunyan’s
    character, the knight wonderfully named “Old Valiant for Truth,” makes the
    only practical bequest available to him when he says at the end of his
    life: “My sword I leave to him who can wear it.” And like this man, I don’t
    mind if I have misappraised my sword, provided I have tried to see it
    correctly, or that many will not wish to try it, or that some who try to
    wield it may find it serves them not. Ben Franklin, to my great benefit,
    left behind his autobiography, his <i>Almanacks,</i>and much else. And
    Ernest Buffett did the best he could in the same mode when he left behind
    “How to Run a Grocery Store and a Few Things I Have Learned about Fishing.”
    Whether or not this last contribution to the genre was the best, I will not
    say. But I will report that I have now known four generations of Ernest
    Buffett’s descendants and that the results have encouraged my imitation of
    the founder.</p>
    <p>I have long been very interested in standard thinking errors. However, I
    was educated in an era wherein the contributions of non-patient-treating
    psychology to an understanding of misjudgment met little approval from
    members of the mainstream elite. Instead, interest in psychology was pretty
    well confined to a group of professors who talked and published mostly for
    themselves, with much natural detriment from isolation and groupthink. And
    so, right after my time at Caltech and Harvard Law School, I possessed a
    vast ignorance of psychology. Those institutions failed to require
    knowledge of the subject. And, of course, they couldn’t integrate
    psychology with their other subject matter when they didn’t know
    psychology. Also, like the Nietzsche character who was proud of his lame
    leg, the institutions were proud of their willful avoidance of “fuzzy”
    psychology and “fuzzy” psychology professors.</p>
    <p>I shared this ignorant mindset for a considerable time. And so did a lot
    of other people. What are we to think, for instance, of the Caltech course
    catalogue that for years listed just one psychology professor,
    self-described as a “Professor of Psychoanalytical Studies,” who taught
    both “Abnormal Psychology” and “Psycho-analysis in Literature”?</p>
    <p>Soon after leaving Harvard, I began a long struggle to get rid of the
    most dysfunctional part of my psychological ignorance. Today, I will
    describe my long struggle for elementary wisdom and a brief summary of my
    ending notions. After that, I will give examples, many quite vivid and
    interesting to me, of both psychology at work and antidotes to
    psychology-based dysfunction. Then, I will end by asking and answering some
    general questions raised by what I have said. This will be a long talk.</p>
    <p>When I started law practice, I had respect for the power of genetic
    evolution and appreciation of man’s many evolution-based resemblances to
    less cognitively-gifted animals and insects. I was aware that man was a
    “social animal,” greatly and automatically influenced by behavior he
    observed in men around him. I also knew that man lived, like barnyard
    animals and monkeys, in limited size dominance hierarchies, wherein he
    tended to respect authority and to like and cooperate with his own
    hierarchy members while displaying considerable distrust and dislike for
    competing men not in his own hierarchy.</p>
    <p>But this generalized, evolution-based theory structure was inadequate to
    enable me to cope properly with the cognition I encountered. I was soon
    surrounded by much extreme irrationality, displayed in patterns and
    subpatterns. So surrounded, I could see that I was not going to cope as
    well as I wished with life unless I could acquire a better theory-structure
    on which to hang my observations and experiences. By then, my craving for
    more theory had a long history. Partly, I had always loved theory as an aid
    in puzzle solving and as a means of satisfying my monkey-like curiosity.
    And, partly. I had found that theory structure was a superpower in helping
    one get what one wanted. As I had early discovered in school wherein I had
    excelled without labor, guided by theory, while many others, without
    mastery of theory, failed despite monstrous effort. Better theory, I
    thought. Had always worked for me and, if now available, could make me
    acquire capital and independence faster and better assist everything I
    loved. And so I slowly developed my own system of psychology. More or less
    in the self-help style of Ben Franklin and with the determination displayed
    in the refrain of the nursery story: “`Then I’ll do it myself,’ said the
    little red hen.”</p>
    <p>I was greatly helped in my quest by two turns of mind. First, I had long
    looked for insight by inversion in the intense manner counseled by the
    great algebraist, Jacobi: “Invert, always invert.” I sought good judgment
    mostly by collecting instances of bad judgment, then pondering ways to
    avoid such outcomes. Second, I became so avid a collector of instances of
    bad judgment that I paid no attention to boundaries between professional
    territories. After all, why should I search for some tiny, unimportant,
    hard-to-find new stupidity in my own field when some large, important,
    easy-to find stupidity was just over the fence in the other fellow’s
    professional territory? Besides, I could already see that real-world
    problems didn’t neatly lie within territorial boundaries. They jumped right
    across. And I was as dubious of any approach that, when two things were
    inextricably intertwined and interconnected, would try and think about one
    thing but not the other. I was afraid, if I tried any such restricted
    approach, that I would end up, in the immortal words of John L. Lewis,
    “with no brain at all, just a neck that had haired over.”</p>
    <p>Pure curiosity, somewhat later, made me wonder how and why destructive
    cults were often able, over a single long weekend, to turn many tolerably
    normal people into brainwashed zombies and thereafter keep them in that
    state indefinitely. I resolved that I would eventually find a good answer
    to this cult question if I could do so by general reading and much
    musing.</p>
    <p>I also got curious about social insects. It fascinated me that both the
    fertile female honeybee and the fertile female harvester ant could multiply
    their quite different normal life expectancies by exactly twenty by
    engaging in one gangbang in the sky. The extreme success of the ants also
    fascinated me-how a few behavioral algorithms caused such extreme
    evolutionary success grounded in extremes of cooperation within the
    breeding colony and, almost always, extremes of lethal hostility toward
    ants outside the breeding colony; even ants of the same species.</p>
    <p>Motivated as I was, by midlife I should probably have turned to
    psychology textbooks, but I didn’t, displaying my share of the outcome
    predicted by the German folk saving: “We are too soon old and too late
    smart.” However, as I later found out, I may have been lucky to avoid for
    so long the academic psychology that was then laid out in most textbooks.
    These would not then have guided me well with respect to cults and were
    often written as if the authors were collecting psychology experiments as a
    boy collects butterflies-with a passion for more butterflies and more
    contact with fellow collectors and little craving for synthesis in what is
    already possessed. When I finally got to the psychology texts, I was
    reminded of the observation of Jacob Viner, the great economist, that many
    an academic is like the truffle hound, an animal so trained and bred for
    one narrow purpose that it is no good at anything else. I was also appalled
    by hundreds of pages of extremely nonscientific musing about comparative
    weights of nature and nurture in human outcomes. And I found that
    introductory psychology texts, by and large, didn’t deal appropriately with
    a fundamental issue: Psychological tendencies tend to be both numerous and
    inseparably intertwined, now and forever, as they interplay in life. Yet
    the complex parsing out of effects from intertwined tendencies was usually
    avoided by the writers of the elementary texts. Possibly the authors did
    not wish, through complexity, to repel entry of new devotees to their
    discipline. And, possibly, the cause of their inadequacy was the one given
    by Samuel Johnson in response to a woman who inquired as to what accounted
    for his dictionary’s misdefinition of the word “pastern.” “Pure ignorance,”
    Johnson replied. And, finally, the text writers showed little interest in
    describing standard antidotes to standard psychology-driven folly, and they
    thus avoided most discussion of exactly what most interested me.</p>
    <p>But academic psychology has some very important merits alongside its
    defects. I learned this eventually, in the course of general reading, from
    a book, <i>Influence,</i>aimed at a popular audience, by a distinguished
    psychology professor, Robert Cialdini, at Arizona State, a very big
    university. Cialdini had made himself into a super-tenured “Regents’
    Professor” at a very young age by devising, describing, and explaining a
    vast group of clever experiments in which man manipulated man to his
    detriment, With all of this made possible by man’s intrinsic thinking
    flaws.</p>
    <p>I immediately sent copies of Cialdini’s book to all my children. I also
    gave Cialdini a share of Berkshire stock [Class A] to thank him for what he
    had done for me and the public. Incidentally, the sale by Cialdini of
    hundreds of thousands of copies of a book about social psychology was a
    huge feat, considering that Cialdini didn’t claim that he was going to
    improve your sex life or make you any money.</p>
    <p>Part of Cialdini’s large bookbuying audience came because, like me, it
    wanted to learn how to become less often tricked by salesmen and
    circumstances. However, as an outcome not sought by Cialdini, who is a
    profoundly ethical man, a huge number of his books were bought by salesmen
    who wanted to learn how to become more effective in misleading customers.
    Please remember this perverse outcome when my discussion comes to
    incentive-caused bias as a consequence of the superpower of incentives.</p>
    <p>With the push given by Cialdini’s book, I soon skimmed through three
    much used textbooks covering introductory psychology. I also pondered
    considerably while craving synthesis and taking into account all my
    previous training and experience. The result was Munger’s partial summary
    of the non-patient-treating, non-nature vs. Nurture weighing parts of
    nondevelopmental psychology. This material was stolen from its various
    discoverers (most of whose names I did not even try to learn), often with
    new descriptions and titles selected to fit Munger’s notion of what makes
    recall easy for Munger, then revised to make Munger’s use easy as he seeks
    to avoid errors.</p>
    <p>I will start my summary with a general observation that helps explain
    what follows. This observation is grounded in what we know about social
    insects. The limitations inherent in evolution’s development of the
    nervous-system cells that control behavior are beautifully demonstrated by
    these insects, which often have a mere 100,000 or so cells in their entire
    nervous systems, compared to man’s multiple billions of cells in his brain
    alone.</p>
    <p>Each ant, like each human, is composed of a living physical structure
    plus behavioral algorithms in its nerve cells. In the ant’s case, the
    behavioral algorithms are few in number and almost entirely genetic in
    origin. The ant learns a little behavior from experiences, but mostly it
    merely responds to ten or so stimuli with a few simple responses programmed
    into its nervous system by its genes, sometimes walk round and round until
    they perish.</p>
    <p>It seems obvious, to me at least, that the human brain must often
    operate counterproductively just like the ant’s, from unavoidable
    oversimplicity in its mental process, albeit usually in trying to solve
    problems more difficult than those faced by ants that don’t have to design
    airplanes.</p>
    <p>Naturally, the simple ant behavior system has extreme limitations
    because of its limited nerve system repertoire. For instance, one type of
    ant, when it smells a pheromone given off by a dead ant’s body in the hive,
    immediately responds by cooperating with other ants in carrying the dead
    body out of the hive. And Harvard’s great E.O. Wilson performed one of the
    best psychology experiments ever done when he painted deadant pheromone on
    a live ant. Quite naturally; the other ants dragged this useful live ant
    out of the hive even though it kicked and otherwise protested throughout
    the entire process. Such is the brain of the ant. It has a simple program
    of responses that generally work out all right, but which are imprudently
    used by rote in many cases.</p>
    <p>Another type of ant demonstrates that the limited brain of ants can be
    misled by circumstances as well as by clever manipulation from other
    creatures. The brain of this ant contains a simple behavioral program that
    directs the ant, when walking, to follow the ant ahead, and when these ants
    stumble into walking in a big circle. The perception system of man clearly
    demonstrates just such an unfortunate outcome. Man is easily fooled, either
    by the cleverly thought out manipulation of man, by circumstances occurring
    by accident, or by very effective manipulation practices that man has
    stumbled into during “practice evolution” and kept in place because they
    work so well. One such outcome is caused by a quantum effect in human
    perception. If stimulus is kept below a certain level, it does not get
    through. And, for this reason, a magician was able to make the Statue of
    Liberty disappear after a certain amount of magician lingo expressed in the
    dark. The audience was not aware that it was sitting on a platform that was
    rotating so slowly, below man’s sensory threshold, that no one could feel
    the acceleration implicit in the considerable rotation. When a surrounding
    curtain was then opened in the place on the platform where the Statue had
    earlier appeared, it seemed to have disappeared.</p>
    <p>And even when perception does get through to man’s brain, it is often
    misweighted, because what is registered in perception is in shockingness of
    apparent contrast, not the standard scientific units that make possible
    science and good engineering against often-wrong effects from generally
    useful tendencies in his perception and cognition.</p>
    <p>A magician demonstrates this sort of contrast based error in your
    nervous system when he removes your wristwatch without your feeling it. As
    he does this, he applies pressure of touch on your wrist that you would
    sense if it was the only pressure of touch you were experiencing. But he
    has concurrently applied other intense pressure of touch on your body, but
    not on your wrist, “swamping” the wrist pressure by creating a
    high-contrast touch pressure elsewhere. This high contrast takes the wrist
    pressure below perception.</p>
    <p>Some psychology professors like to demonstrate the inadequacy of
    contrast-based perception by having students put one hand in a bucket of
    hot water and one hand in a bucket of cold water. They are then suddenly
    asked to remove both hands and place them in a single bucket of room
    temperature water. Now, with both hands in the same water, one hand feels
    as if it has just been put in cold water and the other hand feels as if it
    has just been placed in hot water. When one thus sees perception so easily
    fooled by mere contrast, where a simple temperature gauge would make no
    error, and realizes that cognition mimics perception in being misled by
    mere contrast, he is well on the way toward understanding, not only how
    magicians fool one, but also how life will fool one. This can occur,
    through deliberate human manipulation or otherwise, if one doesn’t take
    certain precautions.</p>
    <p>Man’s often wrong but generally useful psychological tendencies are
    quite numerous and quite different. The natural consequence of this
    profusion of tendencies is the grand general principle of social
    psychology: cognition is ordinarily situation dependent so that different
    situations often cause different conclusions, even when the same person is
    thinking in the same general subject area. With this introductory
    instruction from ants, magicians, and the grand general principle of social
    psychology; I will next simply number and list psychology-based tendencies
    that, while generally useful, often mislead. Discussion of errors from each
    tendency will come later, together with description of some antidotes to
    errors, followed by some general discussion. Here are the ten-dencies:</p>

        <h3>1. Reward and Punishment Superresponse Tendency</h3>
        <p>I place this tendency first in my discussion because almost everyone
        thinks he fully recognizes how important incentives and disincentives
        are in changing cognition and behavior. But this is not often so. For
        instance, I think I’ve been in the top five percent of my age cohort
        almost all my adult life in understanding the power of incentives, and
        yet I’ve always underestimated that power. Never a year passes but I
        get some surprise that pushes a little further my appreciation of
        incentive superpower.</p>
        <p>
        One of my favorite cases about the power of incentives is the Federal
        Express case. The integrity of the Federal Express system requires that
        all packages be shifted rapidly among airplanes in one central airport
        each night. And the system has no integrity for the customers if the
        night work shift can’t accomplish its assignment fast. And Federal
        Express had one hell of a time getting the night shift to do the right
        thing. They tried moral suasion. They tried everything in the world
        without luck. And, finally, somebody got the happy thought that it was
        foolish to pay the night shift by the hour when what the employer
        wanted was not maximized billable hours of employee service but
        fault-free, rapid performance of a particular task. Maybe, this person
        thought, if they paid the employees per shift and let all night shift
        employees go home when all the planes were loaded, the system would
        work better. And, lo and behold, that solution worked.</p>
        <p>
        Early in the history of Xerox, Joe Wilson, who was then in the
        government, had a similar experience. He had to go back to Xerox
        because he couldn’t understand why its new machine was selling so
        poorly in relation to its older and inferior machine. When he got back
        to Xerox, he found out that the commission arrangement with the
        salesmen gave a large and perverse incentive to push the inferior
        machine on customers, who deserved a better result.</p>
        <p>
        And then there is the case of Mark Twain’s cat that, after a bad
        experience with a hot stove, never again sat on a hot stove, or a cold
        stove either.</p>
        <p>We should also heed
        the general lesson implicit in the injunction of Ben Franklin in
        <i>Poor Richard’s Almanack</i>: “If you would persuade, appeal to
        interest and not <i></i>to reason.” This maxim is a wise guide to a
        great and simple precaution in life: Never, ever, think about something
        else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives. I once
        saw a very smart house counsel for a major investment bank lose his
        job, with no moral fault, because he ignored the lesson in this maxim
        of Franklin. This counsel failed to persuade his client because he told
        him his moral duty, as correctly conceived by the counsel, without also
        telling the client in vivid terms that he was very likely to be
        clobbered to smithereens if he didn’t behave as his counsel
        recommended. As a result, both client and counsel lost their careers.
        We should also remember how a foolish and willful ignorance of the
        superpower of rewards caused Soviet communists to get their final
        result as described by one employee: “They pretend to pay us and we
        pretend to work.” Perhaps the most important rule in management is “Get
        the incentives right.”</p>
        <p>
        But there is some limit to a desirable emphasis on incentive
        superpower. One case of excess emphasis happened at Harvard, where B.
        F. Skinner, a psychology professor, finally made himself ridiculous. At
        one time, Skinner may have been the best-known psychology professor in
        the world. He partly deserved his peak reputation because his early
        experiments using rats and pigeons were ingenious, and his results were
        both counter-intuitive and important. With incentives, he could cause
        more behavior change, culminating in conditioned reflexes in his rats
        and pigeons, than he could in any other way. He made obvious the
        extreme stupidity, in dealing with children or employees, of rewarding
        behavior one didn’t want more of. Using food rewards, he even caused
        strong superstitions, predesigned by himself, in his pigeons. He
        demonstrated again and again a great recurring, generalized behavioral
        algorithm in nature: “Repeat behavior that works.” He also demonstrated
        that prompt rewards worked much better than delayed rewards in changing
        and maintaining behavior. And, once his rats and pigeons had
        conditioned reflexes, caused by food rewards, he found what withdrawal
        pattern of rewards kept the reflexive behavior longest in place: random
        distribution. With this result, Skinner thought he had pretty well
        explained man’s misgambling compulsion whereunder he often foolishly
        proceeds to ruin. But, as we shall later see when we discuss other
        psychological tendencies that contribute to misgambling compulsion, he
        was only partly right. Later, Skinner lost most of his personal
        reputation by overclaiming for incentive superpower to the point of
        thinking he could create a human utopia with it and by displaying
        hardly any recognition of the power of the rest of psychology. He thus
        behaved like one of Jacob Viner’s truffle hounds as he tried to explain
        everything with incentive effects. Nonetheless, Skinner was right in
        his main idea: Incentives are superpowers. The outcome of his basic
        experiments will always remain in high repute in the annals of
        experimental science. And his method of monomaniacal reliance on
        rewards, for many decades after his death, did more good than anything
        else in improving autistic children.</p>
        <p> When I was at Harvard Law School, the professors sometimes
        talked about an overfocused, Skinner-like professor at Yale Law School.
        They used to say: “Poor old Eddie Blanchard, he thinks declaratory
        judgments will cure cancer.” Well, that’s the way Skinner got with his
        very extreme emphasis on incentive superpower. I always call the
        “Johnny-one-note” turn of mind that eventually diminished Skinner’s
        reputation the man-with-a-hammer tendency, after the folk saying: “To a
        man with only a hammer every problem looks pretty much like a nail.”
        Man-with-a-hammer tendency does not exempt smart people like Blanchard
        and Skinner. And it won’t exempt you if you don’t watch out. I will
        return to man-with- a-hammer tendency at various times in this talk
        because, fortunately, there are effective anti-dotes that reduce the
        ravages of what pretty much ruined the personal reputation of the
        brilliant Skinner.</p>
        <p>
        One of the most important consequences of incentive superpower is what
        I call “incentive caused bias.” A man has an acculturated nature making
        him a pretty decent fellow, and yet, driven both consciously and
        sub-consciously by incentives, he drifts into immoral behavior in order
        to get what he wants, a result he facilitates by rationalizing his bad
        behavior, like the salesmen at Xerox who harmed customers in order to
        maximize their sales commissions.</p>
        <p>Here, my early
        education involved a surgeon who over the years sent bushel baskets
        full of normal gall bladders down to the pathology lab in the leading
        hospital in Lincoln, Nebraska, my grandfather’s town. And, with that
        permissive quality control for which community hospitals are famous,
        many years after this surgeon should’ve been removed from the medical
        staff, he was. One of the doctors who participated in the removal was a
        family friend, and I asked him: “Did this surgeon think, `Here’s a way
        for me to exercise my talents’” – this guy was very skilled technically
        – “‘and make a high living by doing a few maimings and murders every
        year in the course of routine fraud?’” And my friend answered: “Hell
        no, Charlie. He thought that the gall bladder was the source of all
        medical evil, and, if you really loved your patients, you couldn’t get
        that organ out rapidly enough.”</p>
        <p>
        Now that’s an extreme case, but in lesser strength, the cognitive drift
        of that surgeon is present in every profession and in every human
        being. And it causes perfectly terrible behavior. Consider the
        presentations of brokers selling commercial real estate and businesses.
        I’ve never seen one that I thought was even within hailing distance of
        objective truth. In my long life, I have never seen a management
        consultant’s report that didn’t end with the same advice: “This problem
        needs more management consulting services.” Widespread incentive-caused
        bias requires that one should often distrust, or take with a grain of
        salt, the advice of one’s professional advisor, even if he is an
        engineer. The general <b>antidotes</b> here are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>especially fear
                professional advice when it is especially good for the
                advisor;</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>
                <p>learn and use
                the basic elements of your advisor’s trade as you deal with
                your advisor; and</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
                <p>double check,
                disbelieve, or replace much of what you’re told, to the degree
                that seems appropriate after objective thought.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The power of incentives to cause
        rationalized, terrible behavior is also demonstrated by Defense
        Department procurement history. After the Defense Department had much
        truly awful experience with misbehaving contractors motivated under
        contracts paying on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of cost basis, the
        reaction of our republic was to make it a crime for a contracting
        officer in the Defense Department to sign such a contract, and not only
        a crime, but a felony.</p>
        <p>
        And, by the way, although the government was right to create this new
        felony, much of the way the rest of the world is run, including the
        operation of many law firms and a lot of other firms, is still under
        what is, in essence, a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost reward system.
        And human nature, bedeviled by incentive-caused bias, causes a lot of
        ghastly abuse under these standard incentive patterns of the world. And
        many of the people who are behaving terribly you would be glad to have
        married into your family, compared to what you’re otherwise likely to
        get.</p>
        <p>
        Now there are huge implications from the fact that the human mind is
        put together this way. One implication is that people who create things
        like cash registers, which make dishonest behavior hard to accomplish,
        are some of the effective saints of our civilization because, as
        Skinner so well knew, bad behavior is intensely habit-forming when it
        is rewarded.</p>
        <p>And so the cash
        register was a great moral instrument when it was created. And, by the
        way, Patterson, the great evangelist of the cash register, knew that
        from his own experience. He had a little store, and his employees were
        stealing him blind, so that he never made any money. Then people sold
        him a couple of cash registers, and his store went to profit
        immediately. He promptly closed the store and went into the cash
        register business, creating what became the mighty National Cash
        Register Company, one of the glories of its time. “Repeat behavior that
        works” is a behavioral guide that really succeeded for Patterson, after
        he applied one added twist. And so did high moral cognition. An
        eccentric, inveterate do-gooder (except when destroying competitors,
        all of which he regarded as would-be patent thieves), Patterson, like
        Carnegie, pretty well gave away all his money to charity before he
        died, always pointing out that “shrouds have no pockets.” So great was
        the contribution of Patterson’s cash register to civilization, and so
        effectively did he improve the cash register and spread its use, that
        in the end, he probably deserved the epitaph chosen for the Roman poet
        Horace: “I did not completely die.”</p>
        <p> The strong tendency of employees to rationalize bad
        conduct in order to get rewards requires many antidotes in addition to
        the good cash control promoted by Patterson. Perhaps the most important
        of these antidotes is use of sound accounting theory and practice. This
        was seldom better demonstrated than at Westing-house, which had a
        subsidiary that made loans having no connection to the rest of
        Westinghouse’s businesses. The officers of Westinghouse, perhaps
        influenced by envy of General Electric, wanted to expand profits from
        loans to outsiders. Under Westinghouse’s accounting practice,
        provisions for future credit losses on these loans depended largely on
        the past credit experience of its lending subsidiary, which mainly made
        loans unlikely to cause massive losses.</p>
        <p>Now there are two
        special classes of loans that naturally cause much trouble for lenders.
        The first is ninety-five percent-of-value construction loans to any
        kind of real estate developer, and the second is any kind of
        construction loan on a hotel. So, naturally, if one were willing to
        loan approximately ninety-five percent of the real cost to a developer
        constructing a hotel, the loan would bear a much higher-than-normal
        interest rate because the credit loss danger would be much higher than
        normal. So, sound accounting for Westinghouse in making a big, new mass
        of ninety-five percent-of-value construction loans to hotel developers
        would have been to report almost no profit, or even a loss, on each
        loan until, years later, the loan became clearly worth par. But
        Westinghouse instead plunged into big-time construction lending on
        hotels, using accounting that made its lending officers look good
        because it showed extremely high starting income from loans that were
        very inferior to the loans from which the company had suffered small
        credit losses in the past. This terrible accounting was allowed by both
        international and outside accountants for Westinghouse as they
        displayed the conduct predicted by the refrain: “Whose bread I eat, his
        song I sing.”</p>
        <p>The result was
        billions of dollars of losses. Who was at fault? The guy from the
        refrigerator division, or some similar division, who as lending officer
        was suddenly in charge of loans to hotel developers: Or the accountants
        and other senior people who tolerated a nearly insane incentive
        structure, almost sure to trigger incentive-caused bias in a lending
        officer: My answer puts most blame on the accountants and other senior
        people who created the accounting system. These people became the
        equivalent of an armored car cash carrying service that suddenly
        decided to dispense with vehicles and have unarmed midgets handcarry
        its customers’ cash through slums in open bushel baskets.</p>
        <p>I wish I could tell
        you that this sort of thing no longer happens, but this is not so.
        After Westinghouse blew up, General Electric’s Kidder Peabody
        subsidiary put a silly computer program in place that allowed a bond
        trader to show immense fictional profits. And after that, much
        accounting became even worse, perhaps reaching its nadir at Enron.</p>
        <p>So incentive-caused
        bias is a huge, important thing, with highly important
        <b>antidotes</b>, like the cash register and a sound accounting system.
        But when I came years ago to the psychology texts, I found that, while
        they were about one thousand pages long, there was as little therein
        that dealt with incentive-caused bias and no mention of Patterson or
        sound accounting systems. Somehow incentive-caused bias and its
        antidotes pretty well escaped the standard survey courses in
        psychology, even though incentive-caused bias had long been dis-played
        prominently in much of the world’s great literature, and antidotes to
        it had long existed in standard business routines. In the end, I
        concluded that when something was obvious in life but not easily
        demonstrable in certain kinds of easy, repeatable academic experiments,
        the truffle hounds of psychology very often missed it.</p>
        <p>In
        some cases, other disciplines showed more inter-est in psychological
        tendencies than did psychology, at least as explicated in psychology
        textbooks. For instance, economists, speaking from the employer’s point
        of view, have long had a name for the natural results of
        incentive-caused bias: “agency cost.” As the name implies, the
        economists have typically known that, just as grain is always lost to
        rats, employers always lose to employees who improperly think of
        themselves first. Employer installed <b>antidotes</b> include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>tough internal audit systems,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>severe public punishment for identified miscreants, as well
                as</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                misbehavior-preventing routines and such machines as cash
                registers.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>From the employee’s
        point of view, incentive-caused bias quite naturally causes opposing
        abuse from the employer: the sweatshop, the unsafe work place, etc. And
        these bad results for employees have <b>antidotes</b> not only in</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>pressure from unions, but also in</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>government
                action, such as wage and hour laws, workplace safety rules,
                measures fostering unionization, and workers’ compensation
                systems.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Given the opposing
        psychology-induced strains that naturally occur in employment because
        of incentive-caused bias on both sides of the relationship, it is no
        wonder the Chinese are so much into Yin and Yang.</p>
        <p>
        The inevitable ubiquity of incentive-caused bias has vast, generalized
        consequences. For instance, a sales force living only on commissions
        will be much harder to keep moral than one under less pressure from the
        compensation arrangement. On the other hand, a purely commissioned
        sales force may well be more efficient per dollar spent. Therefore,
        difficult decisions involving trade-offs are common in creating
        compensation arrangements in the sales function.</p>
        <p> The extreme success of free-market capitalism as an
        economic system owes much to its prevention of many of bad effects from
        incentive-caused bias. Most capitalist owners in a vast web of free
        market economic activity are selected for ability by surviving in a
        brutal competition with other owners and have a strong incentive to
        prevent all waste in operations within their ownership. After all, they
        live on the difference between their competitive prices and their
        overall costs and their businesses will perish if costs exceed sales.
        Replace such owners by salaried employees of the state and you will
        normally get a substantial reduction in overall efficiency as each
        employee who replaces an owner is subject to incentive-caused bias as
        he determines what service he will give in exchange for his salary and
        how much he will yield to peer pressure from many fellow employees who
        do not desire his creation of any strong performance model.</p>
        <p>
        Another generalized consequence of incentive caused bias is that man
        tends to “game” all human systems, often displaying great ingenuity in
        wrongly serving himself at the expense of others. Antigaming features,
        therefore, constitute a huge and necessary part of almost all system
        design. Also needed in system design is an admonition: dread, and avoid
        as much you can, reward-ing people for what can be easily faked. Yet
        our legislators and judges, usually including many lawyers educated in
        eminent universities, often ignore this injunction. And society
        consequently pays a huge price in the deterioration of behavior and
        efficiency, as well as the incurrence of unfair costs and wealth
        transfers. If education were improved, with psychological reality
        becoming better taught and assimilated, better system design might well
        come out of our legislatures and courts.</p>
        <p>Of course, money is
        now the main reward that drives habits. A monkey can be trained to seek
        and work for an intrinsically worthless token, as if it were a ba-nana,
        if the token is routinely exchangeable for a banana. So it is also with
        humans working for money – only more so, because human money is
        exchangeable for many desired things in addition to food, and one
        ordinarily gains status from either holding or spending it. Moreover, a
        rich person will often, through habit, work or connive energetically
        for more money long after he has almost no real need for more. Averaged
        out, money is a mainspring of modern civilization, having little
        precedent in the behavior of nonhuman animals. Money rewards are also
        intertwined with other forms of reward. For instance, some people use
        money to buy status and others use status to get money, while still
        others sort of do both things at the same time.</p>
        <p>
        Although money is the main driver among rewards, it is not the only
        reward that works. People also change their behavior and cognition for
        sex, friendship, companionship, advancement in status, and other
        non-monetary items.</p>
        <p>“Granny’s Rule”
        provides another example of re-ward superpower, so extreme in its
        effects that it must be mentioned here. You can successfully manipulate
        your own behavior with this rule, even if you are using as rewards
        items that you already possess! Indeed, con-sultant Ph.D. psychologists
        often urge business organizations to improve their reward systems by
        teaching executives to use “Granny’s Rule” to govern their own daily
        behavior. Granny’s Rule, to be specific, is the requirement that
        children eat their carrots before they get dessert. And the business
        version requires that executives force themselves daily to first do
        their unpleasant and necessary tasks before rewarding themselves by
        proceeding to their pleasant tasks. Given reward super-power, this
        practice is nice and sound. Moreover, the rule can also be used in the
        nonbusiness part of life. The emphasis on daily use of this practice is
        not accidental. The consultants well know, after the teaching of
        Skin-ner, that prompt rewards work best.</p>
        <p>
        Punishments, of course, also strongly influence behavior and cognition,
        although not so flexibly and wonderfully as rewards. For instance,
        illegal price fixing was fairly common in America when it was
        customarily punished by modest fines. Then, after a few prominent
        business executives were removed from their eminent positions and sent
        to federal prisons, price-fixing behavior was greatly reduced.</p>
        <p>Military and naval
        organizations have very often been extreme in using punishment to
        change behavior, probably because they needed to cause extreme
        behavior. Around the time of Caesar, there was a European tribe that,
        when the assembly horn blew, always killed the last warrior to reach
        his assigned place, and no one enjoyed fighting this tribe. And George
        Washington hanged farm-boy deserters forty feet high as an example to
        others who might contemplate desertion.</p>
        <h3>2. Liking/Loving Tendency</h3>
        <p>A newly hatched baby goose is programmed, through the economy of its
        genetic program, to “love” and follow the first creature that is nice
        to it, which is almost always its mother. But, if the mother goose is
        not pre-sent right after the hatching, and a man is there instead, the
        gosling will “love” and follow the man, who be-comes a sort of
        substitute mother.</p>
        <p>
        Somewhat similarly, a newly arrived human is “born to like and love”
        under the normal and abnormal triggering outcomes for its kind. Perhaps
        the strongest in-born tendency to love – ready to be triggered – is
        that of the human mother for its child. On the other hand, the similar
        “child-loving” behavior of a mouse can be eliminated by the deletion of
        a single gene, which suggests there is some sort of triggering gene in
        a mother mouse as well as in a gosling.</p>
        <p>Each child, like a
        gosling, will almost surely come to like and love, not only as driven
        by its sexual nature, but also in social groups not limited to its
        genetic or adoptive “family.” Current extremes of romantic love almost
        surely did not occur in man’s remote past. Our early human ancestors
        were surely more like apes triggered into mating in a pretty mundane
        fashion.</p>
        <p> And what will a man naturally come to like and love, apart
        from his parent, spouse and child? Well, he will like and love being
        liked and loved. And so many a courtship competition will be won by a
        person display-ing exceptional devotion, and man will generally strive,
        lifelong, for the affection and approval of many people not related to
        him. One very practical consequence of Liking/Loving Tendency is that
        it acts as a conditioning device that makes the liker or lover
        tend:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>to ignore faults of, and comply with wishes of, the object
                of his affection,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>to favor people, products, and actions merely associated
                with the object of his affection (as we shall see when we get
                to “Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency,” and</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>to distort
                other facts to facilitate love.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>There are large social
        policy implications in the amazingly good consequences that ordinarily
        come from people likely to trigger extremes of love and admiration
        boosting each other in a feedback mode. For instance, it is obviously
        desirable to attract a lot of lovable, admira-ble people into the
        teaching profession. The phenome-non of liking and loving causing
        admiration also works in reverse. Admiration also causes or intensifies
        liking or love. With this “feedback mode” in place, the consequences
        are often extreme, sometimes even causing deliberate self-destruction
        to help what is loved.</p>
        <p>Liking or loving,
        intertwined with admiration in a feedback mode, often has vast
        practical consequences in areas far removed from sexual attachments.
        For in-stance, a man who is so constructed that he loves admi-rable
        persons and ideas with a special intensity has a huge advantage in
        life. This blessing came to both Buffett and myself in large measure,
        sometimes from the same persons and ideas. One common, beneficial
        exam-ple for us both was Warren’s uncle, Fred Buffett, who cheerfully
        did the endless grocery- store work that Warren and I ended up
        admiring from a safe distance. Even now, after I have known so many
        other people, I doubt if it is possible to be a nicer man than Fred
        Buffett was, and he changed me for the better.</p>
        <h3>3. Disliking/Hating Tendency</h3>
        <p>In a pattern obverse to
        Liking/Loving Tendency, the newly arrived human is also “born to
        dislike and hate” as triggered by normal and abnormal triggering forces
        in its life. It is the same with most apes and monkeys.</p>
        <p>As
        a result, the long history of man contains almost continuous war. For
        instance, most American Indian tribes warred incessantly, and some
        tribes would occa-sionally bring captives home to women so that all
        could join in the fun of torturing captives to death. Even with the
        spread of religion, and the advent of advanced civili-zation, much
        modern war remains pretty savage. But we also get what we observe in
        present-day Switzerland and the United States, wherein the clever
        political arrange-ments of man “channel” the hatreds and dislikings of
        individuals and groups into nonlethal patterns including elections.</p>
        <p>
        But the dislikings and hatreds never go away com-pletely. Born into
        man, these driving tendencies remain strong. Thus, we get maxims like
        the one from England: “Politics is the art of marshalling hatreds.” And
        we also get the extreme popularity of very negative political
        ad-vertising in the United States.</p>
        <p>At
        the family level, we often see one sibling hate his other siblings and
        litigate with them endlessly if he can afford it. Indeed, Warren
        Buffett has repeatedly ex-plained to me that “a major difference
        between rich and poor people is that the rich people can spend their
        lives suing their relatives.” My father’s law practice in Omaha was
        full of such intrafamily hatreds. And when I got to the Harvard Law
        School and its professors taught me “property law” with no mention of
        sibling rivalry in the family business, I appraised the School as a
        pretty unre-alistic place that wore “blinders” like the milk-wagon
        horses of yore. My current guess is that sibling rivalry has not yet
        made it into property law as taught at Harvard.</p>
        <p>
        Disliking/Hating Tendency also acts as a conditioning device that
        makes the disliker/hater tend to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>ignore virtues in the object of dislike,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>dislike people, products, and actions merely associ-ated
                with the object of his dislike, and</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>distort other
                facts to facilitate hatred.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Distortion of that kind is often so extreme that miscognition is
        shockingly large. When the world Trade Center was destroyed, many
        Muslims immediately concluded that the Hindus did it, while many Arabs
        concluded that the Jews did it. Such factual distortions often make
        mediation between opponents locked in hatred either difficult or
        impossible. Mediations between Israelis and Pal-estinians are difficult
        because facts in one side’s history overlap very little with facts from
        the other side’s.</p>
        <h3>4. Doubt-Avoidance Tendency</h3>
        <p>The brain of man is
        programmed with a tendency to quickly remove doubt by reaching some
        decision. It is easy to see how evolution would make animals, over the
        eons, drift toward such quick elimination of doubt. Af-ter all, the one
        thing that is surely counterproductive for a prey animal that is
        threatened by a predator is to take a long time in deciding what to do.
        And so man’s Doubt Avoidance Tendency is quite consistent with the
        history of his ancient, nonhuman ancestors.</p>
        <p>So pronounced is the
        tendency in man to quickly remove doubt by reaching some decision that
        behavior to counter the tendency is required from judges and jurors.
        Here, delay before decision making is forced. And one is required to so
        comport himself, prior to conclusion time, so that he is wearing a
        “mask” of ob-jectivity. And the “mask” works to help real objectivity
        along, as we shall see when we next consider man’s
        In-consistency-Avoidance Tendency.</p>
        <p>Of
        course, once one has recognized that man has a strong Doubt-Avoidance
        Tendency, it is logical to be-lieve that at least some leaps of
        religious faith are greatly boosted by this tendency. Even if one is
        satisfied that his own faith comes from revelation, one still must
        account for the inconsistent faiths of others. And man’s
        Doubt-Avoidance Tendency is almost surely a big part of the answer.</p>
        <p>
        What triggers Doubt-Avoidance Tendency? Well, an unthreatened man,
        thinking of nothing in particular, is not being prompted to remove
        doubt through rushing to some decision. As we shall see later when we
        get to Social-Proof Tendency and Stress-Influence Tendency, what
        usually triggers Doubt-Avoidance Tendency is some combination of
        puzzlement and stress. Both of these factors naturally occur in facing
        religious issues. Thus, the natural state of most men is in some form
        of doubt-removing religious faith.</p>
        <h3>5. Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency</h3>
        <p>The brain of man conserves programming space by be-ing reluctant to
        change, which is a form of inconsistency avoidance. We see this in all
        human habits, constructive and destructive. Few people can list a lot
        of bad habits that they have eliminated, and some people cannot
        iden-tify even one of these. Instead, practically everyone has a great
        many bad habits he has long maintained despite their being known as
        bad. Given this situation, it is not too much in many cases to appraise
        early-formed habits as destiny. When Marley’s miserable ghost says, “I
        wear the chains I forged in life,” he is talking about chains of habit
        that were too light to be felt before they became too strong to be
        broken.</p>
        <p>
        The rare life that is wisely lived has in it many good habits
        maintained and many bad habits avoided or cured. And the great rule
        that helps here is again from Franklin’s <i>Poor Richard’s
        Almanack:</i> “An ounce of preven-tion is worth a pound of cure.” What
        Franklin is here indicating, in part, is that Inconsistency-Avoidance
        Ten-dency makes it much easier to prevent a habit than to change
        it.</p>
        <p>
        Also tending to be maintained in place by the anti-change tendency of
        the brain are one’s previous conclu-sions, human loyalties,
        reputational identity, commit-ments, accepted role in a civilization,
        etc. It is not en-tirely clear why evolution would program into man’s
        brain an anti-change mode alongside his tendency to quickly remove
        doubt. My guess is the anti-change mode was significantly caused by a
        combination of the follow-ing factors:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>It facilitated
                faster decisions when speed of decision was an important
                contribution to the survival of nonhuman ancestors that were
                prey.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>
                <p>It facilitated
                the survival advantage that our ancestors gained by cooperating
                in groups, which would have been more difficult to do if
                everyone was always changing responses.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
                <p>It was the best
                form of solution that evolution could get to in the limited
                number of generations between the start of literacy and today’s
                complex modern life.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>It is easy to see that
        a quickly reached conclusion, trig-gered by Doubt-Avoidance Tendency,
        when combined with a tendency to resist any change in that conclusion,
        will naturally cause a lot of errors in cognition for mod-ern man. And
        so it observably works out. We all deal much with others whom we
        correctly diagnose as imprisoned in poor conclusions that are
        maintained by mental habits they formed early and will carry to their
        graves.</p>
        <p>So great is the
        bad-decision problem caused by Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency that
        our courts have adopted important strategies against it. For instance,
        before making decisions, judges and juries are required to hear long
        and skillful presentations of evidence and argument from the side they
        will not naturally favor, given their ideas in place. And this helps
        prevent considerable bad thinking from “first conclusion bias.”
        Similarly, other modern decision makers will often force groups to
        consider skillful counterarguments before making decisions.</p>
        <p>
        And proper education is one long exercise in augmentation of high
        cognition so that our wisdom becomes strong enough to destroy wrong
        thinking, maintained by resistance to change. As Lord Keynes pointed
        out about his exalted intellectual group at one of the greatest
        universities in the world, it was not the intrinsic difficulty of new
        ideas that prevented their acceptance. Instead, the new ideas were not
        accepted because they were inconsistent with old ideas in place. What
        Keynes was reporting is that the human mind works a lot like the human
        egg. When one sperm gets into a human egg, there’s an automatic
        shut-off device that bars any other sperm from getting in. The human
        mind tends strongly toward the same sort of result.</p>
        <p>
        And so, people tend to accumulate large mental holdings of fixed
        conclusions and attitudes that are not often reexamined or changed,
        even though there is plenty of good evidence that they are wrong.</p>
        <p>Moreover, this
        doesn’t just happen in social science departments, like the one that
        once thought Freud should serve as the only choice as a psychology
        teacher for Caltech. Holding to old errors even happens, although with
        less frequency and severity, in hard science departments. We have no
        less an authority for this than Max Planck, Nobel laureate, finder of
        “Planck’s constant.” Planck is famous not only for his science but also
        for saying that even in physics the radically new ideas are seldom
        really accepted by the old guard. Instead, said Planck, the progress is
        made by a new generation that comes along, less brain-blocked by its
        previous conclu-sions. Indeed, precisely this sort of brain-blocking
        happened to a degree in Einstein. At his peak, Einstein was a great
        destroyer of his own ideas, but an older Einstein never accepted the
        full implications of quantum mechanics.</p>
        <p> One of the most successful users of an antidote to first
        conclusion bias was Charles Darwin. He trained himself, early, to
        intensively consider any evidence tending to disconfirm any hypothesis
        of his, more so if he thought his hypothesis was a particularly good
        one. The opposite of what Darwin did is now called confirmation bias, a
        term of opprobrium. Darwin’s practice came from his acute recognition
        of man’s natural cognitive faults arising from Inconsistency-Avoidance
        Tendency. He provides a great example of psychological insight
        correctly used to advance some of the finest mental work ever done.</p>
        <p>
        Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency has many good effects in civilization.
        For instance, rather than act in-consistently with public commitments,
        new or old public identities, etc., most people are more loyal in their
        roles in life as priests, physicians, citizens, soldiers, spouses,
        teachers, employees, etc.</p>
        <p>
        One corollary of Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency is that a person
        making big sacrifices in the course of assuming a new identity will
        intensify his devotion to the new identity. After all, it would be
        quite inconsistent behavior to make a large sacrifice for something
        that was no good. And thus civilization has invented many tough and
        solemn initiation ceremonies, often public in nature, that intensify
        new commitments made.</p>
        <p>
        Tough initiation ceremonies can intensify bad con-tact as well as good.
        The loyalty of the new, “made-man” mafia member, or of the military
        officer making the required “blood oath” of loyalty to Hitler, was
        boosted through the triggering of Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the
        tendency will often make man a “patsy” of manipulative
        “compliance-practitioners,” who gain advantage from triggering his
        subconscious Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency. Few people demonstrated
        this process better than Ben Franklin. As he was rising from obscurity
        in Philadelphia and wanted the approval of some important man, Franklin
        would often maneuver that man into doing Franklin some unimportant
        favor, like lending Franklin a book. Thereafter, the man would admire
        and trust Franklin more because a nonadmired and nontrusted Franklin
        would be inconsistent with the appraisal implicit in lending Franklin
        the book.</p>
        <p>During the Korean
        War, this technique of Franklin’s was the most important feature of the
        Chinese brainwashing system that was used on enemy prisoners. Small
        step by small step, the technique often worked better than torture in
        altering prisoner cognition in favor of Chinese captors.</p>
        <p>The practice of
        Franklin, whereunder he got approval from someone by maneuvering him
        into treating Franklin favorably, works viciously well in reverse. When
        one is maneuvered into deliberately hurting some other person, one will
        tend to disapprove or even hate that person. This effect, from
        Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency, accounts for the insight implicit in
        the saying: “A man never forgets where he has buried the hatchet.” The
        effect accounts for much prisoner abuse by guards, increasing their
        dislike and hatred for prisoners that exists as a consequence of the
        guards’ reciprocation of hostility from prisoners who are treated like
        animals. Given the psychology-based hostility natural in prisons
        between guards and prisoners, an intense, continuous effort should be
        made to prevent prisoner abuse from starting and to stop it instantly
        when it starts because it will grow by feeding on itself, like a
        cluster of infectious disease. More psychological acuity on this
        subject, aided by more insightful teaching, would probably improve the
        overall effectiveness of the U.S. Army.</p>
        <p>So
        strong is Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency that it will often prevail
        after one has merely pretended to have some identity, habit, or
        conclusion. Thus, for a while, many an actor sort of believes he is
        Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. And many a hypocrite is improved by his
        pretensions of virtue. And many a judge and juror, while pretending
        objectivity, is gaining objectivity. And many a trial lawyer or other
        advocate comes to believe what he formerly only pretended to
        believe.</p>
        <p>While
        Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency, with its “status quo bias,” immensely
        harms sound education, it also causes much benefit. For instance, a
        near-ultimate inconsistency would be to teach something to others that
        one did not believe true. And so, in clinical medical education, the
        learner is forced to “see one, do one, and then teach one,” with the
        teaching pounding the learning into the teacher. Of course, the power
        of teaching to influence the cognition of the teacher is not always a
        benefit to society. When such power flows into political and cult
        evangelism, there are often bad consequences.</p>
        <p>For instance, modern
        education often does much damage when young students are taught dubious
        political notions and then enthusiastically push these notions on the
        rest of us. The pushing seldom convinces others. But as students pound
        into their mental habits what they are pushing out, the students are
        often permanently damaged. Educational institutions that create a
        climate where much of this goes on are, I think, irresponsible. It is
        important not to thus put one’s brain in chains before one has come
        anywhere near his full potentiality as a rational person.</p>
        <h3>6. Curiosity Tendency</h3>
        <p> There is a lot of innate curiosity in mammals, but its
        nonhuman version is highest among apes and monkeys. Man’s curiosity, in
        turn, is much stronger than that of his simian relatives. In advanced
        human civilization, culture greatly increases the effectiveness of
        curiosity in advancing knowledge. For instance, Athens (including its
        colony, Alexandria) developed much math and science out of pure
        curiosity while the Romans made almost no contribution to either math
        or science. They instead concentrated their attention on the
        “practical” engineering of mines, roads, aqueducts, etc. Curiosity,
        enhanced by the best of modern education (which is by definition a
        minority part in many places), much helps man to prevent or reduce bad
        consequences arising from other psychological tendencies. The curious
        are also provided with much fun and wisdom long after formal education
        has ended.</p>
        <h3>7. Kantian Fairness Tendency</h3>
        <p>Kant was famous for his
        “categorical imperative,” a sort of a “golden rule” that required
        humans to follow those behavior patterns that, if followed by all
        others, would make the surrounding human system work best for
        everybody. And it is not too much to say that modern acculturated man
        displays, and expects from others, a lot of fairness as thus defined by
        Kant.</p>
        <p>In a small community
        having a one-way bridge or tunnel for autos, it is the norm in the
        United States to see a lot of reciprocal courtesy, despite the absence
        of signs or signals. And many freeway drivers, including myself, will
        often let other drivers come in front of them, in lane changes or the
        like, because that is the courtesy they desire when roles are reversed.
        Moreover, there is, in modern human culture, a lot of courteous lining
        up by strangers so that all are served on a “first-come-first-served”
        basis.</p>
        <p>
        Also, strangers often voluntarily share equally in unexpected, unearned
        good and bad fortune. And, as an obverse consequence of such
        “fair-sharing” conduct, much reactive hostility occurs when fairsharing
        is expected yet not provided.</p>
        <p>It
        is interesting how the world’s slavery was pretty well abolished during
        the last three centuries after being tolerated for a great many
        previous centuries during which it coexisted with the world’s major
        religions. My guess is that Kantian Fairness Tendency was a major
        contributor to this result.</p>
        <h3>8. Envy/Jealousy Tendency</h3>
        <p>A member of a species designed through evolutionary process to want
        often-scarce food is going to be driven strongly toward getting food
        when it first sees food. And this is going to occur often and tend to
        create some conflict when the food is seen in the possession of
        an-other member of the same species. This is probably the evolutionary
        origin of the Envy/Jealousy Tendency that lies so deep in human nature.
        Sibling jealousy is clearly very strong and usually greater in children
        than adults. It is often stronger than jealousy directed at strangers.
        Kantian Fairness Tendency probably contributes to this result.</p>
        <p>Envy/jealousy is
        extreme in myth, religion, and literature wherein, in account after
        account, it triggers hatred and injury. It was regarded as so
        pernicious by the Jews of the civilization that preceded Christ that it
        was forbidden, by phrase after phrase, in the laws of Moses. You were
        even warned by the Prophet not to covet your neighbor’s donkey.</p>
        <p>
        And envy/jealousy is also extreme in modern life. For instance,
        university communities often go bananas when some university employee
        in money management, or some professor in surgery, gets annual
        compensation in multiples of the standard professorial salary. And in
        modern investment banks, law firms, etc., the envy/jealousy effects are
        usually more extreme than they are in university faculties. Many big
        law firms, fearing disorder from envy/jealousy, have long treated all
        senior partners alike in compensation, no matter how different their
        contributions to firm welfare. As I have shared the observation of life
        with Warren Buffett over decades, I have heard him wisely say on
        several occasions: “It is not greed that drives the world, but
        envy.”</p>
        <p>
        And, because this is roughly right, one would expect a vast coverage of
        envy/jealousy in psychology textbooks. But no such vast coverage
        existed when I read my three textbooks. Indeed, the very words “envy”
        and “jealousy” were often absent from the index.</p>
        <p>
        Nondiscussion of envy/jealousy is not a phenomenon confined to
        psychology texts. When did any of you last engage in any large group
        discussion of some issue wherein adult envy/jealousy was identified as
        the cause of someone’s argument? There seems to be a general taboo
        against any such claim. If so, what accounts for the taboo?</p>
        <p>My guess is that
        people widely and generally sense that labeling some position as driven
        by envy/jealousy will be regarded as extremely insulting to the
        position taker, possibly more so when the diagnosis is correct than
        when it is wrong. And if calling a position “envy-driven” is perceived
        as the equivalent of describing its holder as a childish mental basket
        case, then it is quite understandable how a general taboo has
        arisen.</p>
        <p>But should this
        general taboo extend to psychology texts when it creates such a large
        gap in the correct, psychological explanation of what is widespread and
        important? My answer is no.</p>
        <h3>9. Reciprocation Tendency</h3>
        <p>The automatic tendency of humans to reciprocate both favors and
        disfavors has long been noticed as it is in apes, monkeys, dogs, and
        many less cognitively gifted animals. The tendency facilitates group
        cooperation for the benefit of members. In this respect, it mimics much
        genetic programming of the social insects. We see the extreme power of
        the tendency to reciprocate disfavors in some wars, wherein it
        increases hatred to a level causing very brutal conduct. For long
        stretches in many wars, no prisoners were taken; the only acceptable
        enemy a dead one. And sometimes that was not enough, as in the case of
        Genghis Khan, who was not satisfied with corpses. He insisted on their
        being hacked into pieces.</p>
        <p> One interesting mental exercise is to compare Genghis
        Khan, who exercised extreme, lethal hostility to-ward other men, with
        ants that display extreme, lethal hostility toward members of their own
        species that are not part of their breeding colony. Genghis looks
        sweetly lovable when compared to the ants. The ants are more disposed
        to fight and fight with more extreme cruelty.</p>
        <p>Indeed, E. O. Wilson
        once waggishly suggested that if ants were suddenly to get atom bombs,
        all ants would be dead within eighteen hours. What both human and ant
        history suggest is</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>that nature has
                no general algorithm making intra-species, turn-the-other-cheek
                behavior a booster of species survival;</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>
                <p>that it is not
                clear that a country would have good prospects were it to
                abandon all reciprocate-disfavor tendency directed at
                outsiders; and</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
                <p>if
                turn-the-other-cheek behavior is a good idea for a country as
                it deals with outsiders, man’s culture is going to have to do a
                lot of heavy lifting because his genes won’t be of much
                help.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>I next turn to man’s
        reciprocated hostility that falls well short of war. Peacetime
        hostility can be pretty extreme, as in many modern cases of “road rage”
        or injury-producing temper tantrums on athletic fields.</p>
        <p>
        The standard antidote to one’s overactive hostility is to train oneself
        to defer reaction. As my smart friend Tom Murphy so frequently says,
        “You can always tell the man off tomorrow, if it is such a good
        idea.”</p>
        <p>Of
        course, the tendency to reciprocate favor for favor is also very
        intense, so much so that it occasionally reverses the course of
        reciprocated hostility. Weird pauses in fighting have sometimes
        occurred right in the middle of wars, triggered by some minor courtesy
        or favor on the part of one side, followed by favor reciprocation from
        the other side, and so on, until fighting stopped for a considerable
        period. This happened more than once in the trench warfare of World War
        I, over big stretches of the front and much to the dismay of the
        generals.</p>
        <p>It is obvious that
        commercial trade, a fundamental cause of modern prosperity, is
        enormously facilitated by man’s innate tendency to reciprocate favors.
        In trade, enlightened self-interest joining with Reciprocation Tendency
        results in constructive conduct. Daily inter-change in marriage is also
        assisted by Reciprocation Tendency, without which marriage would lose
        much of its allure.</p>
        <p>And Reciprocation
        Tendency, insomuch as it causes good results, does not join forces only
        with the super-power of incentives. It also joins
        Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency in helping cause:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>the fulfillment
                of promises made as part of a bar-gain, including loyalty
                promises in marriage ceremonies, and</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>
                <p>correct
                behavior expected from persons serving as priests, shoemakers,
                physicians, and all else.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Like other
        psychological tendencies, and also man’s ability to turn somersaults,
        reciprocate-favor tendency operates to a very considerable degree at a
        subconscious level. This helps make the tendency a strong force that
        can sometimes be used by some men to mislead others, which happens all
        the time.</p>
        <p>For instance, when an automobile salesman
        graciously steers you into a comfortable place to sit and gives you a
        cup of coffee, you are very likely being tricked, by this small
        courtesy alone, into parting with an extra five hundred dollars. This
        is far from the most extreme case of sales success that is rooted in a
        salesman dispensing minor favors. However, in this scenario of buying a
        car, you are going to be disadvantaged by parting with an extra five
        hundred dollars of your own money. This potential loss will protect you
        to some ex-tent.</p>
        <p>
        But suppose you are the purchasing agent of some-one else – a rich
        employer, for instance. Now the minor favor you receive from the
        salesman is less opposed by the threat of extra cost to you because
        someone else is paying the extra cost. Under such circumstances, the
        salesman is often able to maximize his advantage, particularly when
        government is the purchaser.</p>
        <p>Wise employers,
        therefore, try to oppose reciprocate -favor tendencies of employees
        engaged in purchasing. The simplest antidote works best: Don’t let them
        accept any favors from vendors. Sam Walton agreed with this idea of
        absolute prohibition. He wouldn’t let purchasing agents accept so much
        as a hot dog from a vendor. Given the subconscious level at which much
        Reciprocation Tendency operates, this policy of Walton’s was profoundly
        correct. If I controlled the Defense Department, its policies would
        mimic Walton’s.</p>
        <p>In a famous
        psychology experiment, Cialdini brilliantly demonstrated the power of
        “compliance practitioners” to mislead people by triggering their
        subconscious Reciprocation Tendency.</p>
        <p>Carrying out this
        experiment, Cialdini caused his “compliance practitioners” to wander
        around his cam-pus and ask strangers to supervise a bunch of juvenile
        delinquents on a trip to a zoo. Because this happed on a campus, one
        person in six out of a large sample actually agreed to do this. After
        accumulating this one-in-six statistic, Cialdini changed his procedure.
        His practitioners next wandered around the campus asking strangers to
        devote a big chunk of time every week for two years to the supervision
        of juvenile delinquents. This ridiculous request got him a one hundred
        percent rejection rate. But the practitioner had a follow-up question:
        “Will you at least spend one afternoon taking juvenile delinquents to a
        zoo?” This raised Cialdini’s former acceptance rate of 1/6 to ½ – a
        tripling.</p>
        <p>
        What Cialdini’s “compliance
        practitioners” had done was make a small concession, which was
        reciprocated by a small concession from the other side. This
        subconscious reciprocation of a concession by Cialdini’s experimental
        subjects actually caused a much increased percentage of them to end up
        irrationally agreeing to go to a zoo with juvenile delinquents. Now, a
        professor who can invent an experiment like that, which so power-fully
        demonstrates something so important, deserves much recognition in the
        wider world, which he indeed got to the credit of many universities
        that learned a great deal from Cialdini.</p>
        <p>Why is Reciprocation
        Tendency so important? Well, consider the folly of having law students
        graduate, and go out in the world representing clients in negotiations,
        not knowing the nature of the subconscious processes of the mind as
        exhibited in Cialdini’s experiment. Yet such folly was prevalent in the
        law schools of the world for decades, in fact, generations. The correct
        name for that is educational malpractice. The law schools didn’t know,
        or care to teach, what Sam Walton so well knew.</p>
        <p>
        The importance and power of reciprocate-favor tendency was also
        demonstrated in Cialdini’s explanation of the foolish decision of the
        attorney general of the United States to authorize the Watergate
        burglary. There, an aggressive subordinate made some extreme proposal
        for advancing Republican interests through use of some combination of
        whores and a gigantic yacht. When this ridiculous request was rejected,
        the subordinate backed off, in gracious concession, to merely asking
        for consent to a burglary, and the attorney general went along.
        Cialdini believes that subconscious Reciprocation Tendency thus became
        one important cause of the resignation of a United States president in
        the Watergate debacle, and so do I. Reciprocation Tendency subtly
        causes many extreme and dangerous consequences, not just on rare
        occasions but pretty much all the time.</p>
        <p>
        Man’s belief in reciprocate-favor tendency, following eons of his
        practicing it, has done some queer and bad things in religions. The
        ritualized murder of the Phoenicians and the Aztecs, in which they
        sacrificed human victims to their gods, was a particularly egregious
        example. And we should not forget that as late as the Punic Wars, the
        civilized Romans, out of fear of defeat, returned in a few instances to
        the practice of human sacrifice. On the other hand, the
        reciprocity-based, religion-boosting idea of obtaining help from God in
        reciprocation for good human behavior has probably been vastly
        constructive.</p>
        <p>
        Overall, both inside and outside religions, it seems clear to me that
        Reciprocation Tendency’s constructive contributions to man far outweigh
        its destructive effects. In cases of psychological tendencies being
        used to counter or prevent bad results from one or more other
        psychological tendencies – for instance, in the case of interventions
        to end chemical dependency – you will usually find Reciprocation
        Tendency performing strongly on the constructive side.</p>
        <p>
        And the very best part of human life probably lies in relationships of
        affection wherein parties are more interested in pleasing than being
        pleased – a not uncommon outcome in display of reciprocate favor
        tendency.</p>
        <p>
        Before we leave reciprocate- favor tendency, the final phenomenon we
        will consider is widespread human misery from feelings of guilt. To the
        extent the feeling of guilt has an evolutionary base, I believe the
        most plausible cause is the mental conflict triggered in one direction
        by reciprocate favor tendency and in the opposite direction by Reward
        Superresponse Tendency pushing one to enjoy one hundred percent of some
        good thing. Of course, human culture has often greatly boosted the
        genetic tendency to suffer from feelings of guilt. Most especially,
        religious culture has imposed hard-to-follow ethical and devotional
        demands on people. There is a charming Irish Catholic priest in my
        neighborhood who, with rough accuracy, often says, “The old Jews may
        have invented guilt, but we Catholics perfected it.” And if you, like
        me and this priest, believe that, averaged out, feelings of guilt do
        more good than harm, you may join in my special gratitude for
        reciprocate-favor tendency; no matter how unpleasant you find feelings
        of guilt.</p>
        <h3>10. Influence-from-Mere Association Tendency</h3>
        <p>In the standard
        conditioned reflexes studied by Skinner and most common in the world,
        responsive behavior, creating a new habit, is directly triggered by
        rewards previously bestowed. For instance, a man buys a can of branded
        shoe polish, has a good experience with it when shining his shoes, and
        because of this “reward,” buys the same shoe polish when he needs
        another can.</p>
        <p>But there is another
        type of conditioned reflex wherein mere association triggers a
        response. For in-stance, consider the case of many men who have been
        trained by their previous experience in life to believe that when
        several similar items are presented for pur-chase, the one with the
        highest price will have the high-est quality. Knowing this, some seller
        of an ordinary industrial product will often change his product’s trade
        dress and raise its price significantly hoping that quality-seeking
        buyers will be tricked into becoming purchasers by mere association of
        his product and its high price. This industrial practice frequently is
        effective in driving up sales and even more so in driving up profits.
        For instance, it worked wonderfully with high-priced power tools for a
        long time. And it would work better yet with highpriced pumps at the
        bottom of oil wells. With luxury goods, the process works with a
        special boost be-cause buyers who pay high prices often gain extra
        status from thus demonstrating both their good taste and their ability
        to pay.</p>
        <p>Even association
        that appears to be trivial, if care-fully planned, can have extreme and
        peculiar effects on purchasers of products. The target purchaser of
        shoe polish may like pretty girls. And so he chooses the pol-ish with
        the pretty girl on the can or the one with the pretty girl in the last
        ad for shoe polish that he saw.</p>
        <p>Advertisers know
        about the power of mere association. You won’t see Coke advertised
        alongside some account of the death of a child. Instead, Coke ads
        picture life as happier than reality.</p>
        <p>
        Similarly, it is not from mere chance
        that military bands play such impressive music. That kind of music,
        appearing in mere association with military service, helps to attract
        soldiers and keep them in the army. Most armies have learned to use
        mere association in this successful way.</p>
        <p>
        However, the most damaging miscalculations from mere association do not
        ordinarily come from advertisers and music providers.</p>
        <p>
        Some of the most important miscalculations come from what is
        accidentally associated with one’s past success, or one’s liking and
        loving, or one’s disliking and hating, which includes a natural hatred
        for bad news.</p>
        <p>To
        avoid being misled by the mere association of some fact with past
        success, use this memory clue. Think of Napoleon and Hitler when they
        invaded Russia after using their armies with much success elsewhere.
        And there are plenty of mundane examples of results like those of
        Napoleon and Hitler. For instance, a man foolishly gambles in a casino
        and yet wins. This unlikely correlation causes him to try the casino
        again, or again and again, to his horrid detriment. Or a man gets lucky
        in an odds-against venture headed by an untalented friend. So
        influenced, he tries again what worked before</p>
        <p>– with terrible results.</p>
        <p>
        The proper <b>antidotes</b> to being made such a patsy by past success
        are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>to carefully
                examine each past success, looking for accidental, noncausative
                factors associated with such success that will tend to mislead
                as one appraises odds implicit in a proposed new undertaking,
                and</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>
                <p>to look for
                dangerous aspects of the new undertaking that were not present
                when past success occurred.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The damage to the mind
        that can come from liking and loving was once demonstrated by obviously
        false testimony given by an otherwise very admirable woman, the wife of
        a party in a jury case. The famous opposing counsel wanted to minimize
        his attack on such an admirable woman yet destroy the credibility of
        her testimony. And so, in his closing argument, he came to her
        testimony last. He then shook his head sadly and said, “What are we to
        make of such testimony? The answer lies in the old rhyme:</p>
        <p>As the
        husband is, So the wife is. She is married to a clown,</p>
        <p>
        And the grossness of his nature Drags her down.”</p>
        <p>The jury disbelieved
        the woman’s testimony. They easily recognized the strong misinfluence
        of love on her cognition. And we now often see even stronger
        misinfluence from love as tearful mothers, with heartfelt conviction,
        declare before TV cameras the innocence of their obviously guilty
        sons.</p>
        <p>People disagree
        about how much blindness should accompany the association called love.
        In <i>Poor Richard’s</i> <i>Almanack</i> Franklin counseled: “Keep your
        eyes wide <i></i>open before marriage and half shut thereafter.”
        Perhaps this “eyes-half-shut” solution is about right, but I favor a
        tougher prescription: “See it like it is and love anyway.”</p>
        <p>
        Hating and disliking also cause miscalculation triggered by mere
        association. In business, I commonly see people underappraise both the
        competency and morals of competitors they dislike. This is a dangerous
        practice, usually disguised because it occurs on a subconscious
        basis.</p>
        <p>
        Another common bad effect from the mere association of a person and a
        hated outcome is displayed in “Persian Messenger Syndrome.” Ancient
        Persians actually killed some messengers whose sole fault was that they
        brought home truthful bad news, say, of a battle lost. It was actually
        safer for the messenger to run away and hide, instead of doing his job
        as a wiser boss would have wanted it done.</p>
        <p>
        And Persian Messenger Syndrome is alive and well in modern life, albeit
        in less lethal versions. It is actually dangerous in many careers to be
        a carrier of unwelcome news. Union negotiators and employer
        representatives often know this, and it leads to many tragedies in
        labor relations. Sometimes lawyers, knowing their clients will hate
        them if they recommend an unwelcome but wise settlement, will carry on
        to disaster. Even in places well known for high cognition, one will
        sometimes find Persian Messenger Syndrome. For instance, years ago, two
        major oil companies litigated in a Texas trial court over some
        ambiguity in an operating agreement covering one of the largest oil
        reservoirs in the Western hemisphere. My guess is that the cause of the
        trial was some general counsel’s unwillingness to carry bad news to a
        strong-minded CEO.</p>
        <p>
        CBS, in its late heyday, was famous for occurrence of Persian Messenger
        Syndrome because Chairman Bill Paley was hostile to people who brought
        him bad news. The result was that Paley lived in a cocoon of unreality,
        from which he made one bad deal after another, even exchanging a large
        share of CBS for a company that had to be liquidated shortly
        thereafter.</p>
        <p>The proper antidote
        to creating Persian Messenger Syndrome and its bad effects, like those
        at CBS, is to develop, through exercise of will, a habit of welcoming
        bad news. At Berkshire, there is a common injunction: “Always tell us
        the bad news promptly. It is only the good news that can wait.” It also
        helps to be so wise and informed that people fear not telling you bad
        news be-cause you are so likely to get it elsewhere.</p>
        <p> Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency often has a
        shocking effect that helps swamp the normal tendency to return favor
        for favor, [especially when the favor recipient’s] condition is
        unpleasant, due to poverty, sickness, subjugation, or something else.
        Some-times, when one receives a favor, the favor may trigger an
        envy-driven dislike for the person who was in so favorable a state that
        he could easily be a favor giver. Under such circumstances, the favor
        receiver, prompted partly by mere association of the favor giver with
        past pain, will not only dislike the man who helped him but also try to
        injure him. This accounts for a famous response, sometimes dubiously
        attributed to Henry Ford: “Why does that man hate me so? I never did
        anything for him.”</p>
        <p>I have a friend,
        whom I will now call “Glotz,” who had an amusing experience in
        favor-giving. Glotz owned an apartment building that he had bought
        because he wanted, eventually, to use the land in different
        development. Pending this outcome, Glotz was very lenient in collecting
        below-market rents from tenants. When, at last, there was a public
        hearing on Glotz’s proposal to tear down the building, one tenant who
        was far behind in his rent payments was particularly angry and hostile.
        He came to the public hearing and said, “This proposal is outrageous.
        Glotz doesn’t need any more money. I know this because I was supported
        in college by Glotz fellowships.”</p>
        <p>A final serious
        clump of bad thinking caused by mere association lies in the common use
        of classification stereotypes. Because Pete knows that Joe is ninety
        years old and that most ninety-year-old persons don’t think very well,
        Pete appraises old Joe as a thinking klutz even if old Joe still thinks
        very well. Or, because Jane is a white-haired woman, and Pete knows no
        old women good at higher math, Pete appraises Jane as no good at it
        even if Jane is a whiz. This sort of wrong thinking is both natural and
        common. Pete’s <b>antidote</b> is not to believe that, on average,
        ninety-year-olds think as well as forty year-olds or that there are as
        many females as males among Ph.D.’s in math. Instead, just as he must
        learn that trend does not always correctly predict des-tiny, he must
        learn that the average dimension in some group will not reliably guide
        him to the dimension of some specific item. Otherwise Pete will make
        many er-rors, like that of the fellow who drowned in a river that
        averaged out only eighteen inches deep.</p>
        <h3>11. Simple, Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial</h3>
        <p>This phenomenon first
        hit me hard in World War II when the superathlete, superstudent son of
        a family friend flew off over the Atlantic Ocean and never came back.
        His mother, who was a very sane woman, then refused to believe he was
        dead. That’s Simple, Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial. The reality is
        too painful to bear, so one distorts the facts until they become
        bear-able. We all do that to some extent, often causing terri-ble
        problems. The tendency’s most extreme outcomes are usually mixed up
        with love, death, and chemical de-pendency.</p>
        <p>Where denial is used
        to make dying easier, the con-duct meets almost no criticism. Who would
        begrudge a fellow man such help at such a time? But some people hope to
        leave life hewing to the iron prescription, “It is not necessary to
        hope in order to persevere.” And there is something admirable in anyone
        able to do this.</p>
        <p>In chemical
        dependency, wherein morals usually break down horribly, addicted
        persons tend to believe that they remain in respectable condition, with
        respect-able prospects. They thus display an extremely unrealis-tic
        denial of reality as they go deeper and deeper into deterioration. In
        my youth, Freudian remedies failed utterly in reversing chemical
        dependency, but nowadays Alcoholics Anonymous routinely achieves a
        fifty percent cure rate by causing several psychological tendencies to
        act together to counter addiction. However, the cure process is
        typically difficult and draining, and a fifty per-cent success rate
        implies a fifty percent failure rate. One should stay far away from any
        conduct at all likely to drift into chemical dependency. Even a small
        chance of suffering so great a damage should be avoided.</p>
        <h3>12. Excessive Self-Regard Tendency</h3>
        <p>We all commonly observe
        the excessive self -regard of man. He mostly misappraises himself on
        the high side, like the ninety percent of Swedish drivers that judge
        themselves to be above average. Such misappraisals also apply to a
        person’s major “possessions.” One spouse usually overappraises the
        other spouse. And a man’s children are likewise appraised higher by him
        than they are likely to be in a more objective view. Even man’s minor
        possessions tend to be overappraised. Once owned, they suddenly become
        worth more to him than he would pay if they were offered for sale to
        him and he didn’t already own them. There is a name in psychology for
        this overappraisal-of-our-own-possessions phe-nomenon: the “endowment
        effect.” And all man’s deci-sions are suddenly regarded by him as
        better than would have been the case just before he made them.</p>
        <p>
        Man’s excess of self-regard typically makes him strongly prefer people
        like himself. Psychology profes-sors have had much fun demonstrating
        this effect in “lost-wallet” experiments. Their experiments all show
        that the finder of a lost wallet containing identity clues will be most
        likely to return the wallet when the owner most closely resembles the
        finder. Given this quality in psychosocial nature, cliquish groups of
        similar persons will always be a very influential part of human
        culture, even after we wisely try to dampen the worst effects.</p>
        <p>
        Some of the worst consequences in
        modern life come when dysfunctional groups of cliquish persons,
        dominated by Excessive Self-Regard Tendency, select as new members of
        their organizations persons who are very much like themselves. Thus if
        the English department at an elite university becomes mentally
        dysfunctional or the sales department of a brokerage firm slips into
        routine fraud, the problem will have a natural tendency to get worse
        and to be quite resistant to change for the better. So also with a
        police department or prison-guard unit or political group gone sour and
        countless other places mired in evil and folly, such as the worst of
        our big-city teachers’ unions that harm our children by preventing
        discharge of ineffective teachers. Therefore, some of the most useful
        members of our civilization are those who are willing to “clean house”
        when they find a mess under their ambit of control.</p>
        <p>Well, naturally, all
        forms of excess of self-regard cause much error. How could it be
        otherwise?</p>
        <p>Let us consider some
        foolish gambling decisions. In lotteries, the play is much lower when
        numbers are distributed randomly than it is when the player picks his
        own number. This is quite irrational. The odds are almost exactly the
        same and much against the player. Be-cause state lotteries take
        advantage of man’s irrational love of self-picked numbers, modern man
        buys more lottery tickets than he otherwise would have, with each
        purchase foolish.</p>
        <p>
        Intensify man’s love of his own conclusions by adding the possessory
        wallop from the “endowment effect,” and you will find that a man who
        has already bought a pork-belly future on a commodity exchange now
        foolishly believes, even more strongly than before, in the merits of
        his speculative bet.</p>
        <p>
        And foolish sports betting, by people who love sports and think they
        know a lot about relative merits of teams, is a lot more addictive than
        race track betting – partly because of man’s automatic overappraisal of
        his own complicated conclusions.</p>
        <p>Also extremely
        counterproductive is man’s tendency to bet, time after time, in games
        of skill, like golf or poker, against people who are obviously much
        better players. Excessive Self-Regard Tendency diminishes the foolish
        bettor’s accuracy in appraising his relative degree of talent.</p>
        <p>More
        counterproductive yet are man’s appraisals, typically excessive, of the
        quality of the future service he is to provide to his business. His
        overappraisal of these prospective contributions will frequently cause
        disaster.</p>
        <p>Excesses of
        self-regard often cause bad hiring decisions because employers grossly
        overappraise the worth of their own conclusions that rely on
        impressions in face- to- face contact. The correct antidote to this
        sort of folly is to underweigh face-to-face impressions and overweigh
        the applicant’s past record.</p>
        <p>I once chose exactly
        this course of action while I served as chairman of an academic search
        committee. I convinced fellow committee members to stop all further
        interviews and simply appoint a person whose achieve-ment record was
        much better than that of any other applicant. And when it was suggested
        to me that I wasn’t giving “academic due process,” I replied that I was
        the one being true to academic values because I was using academic
        research showing poor predictive value of impressions from face-to-face
        interviews.</p>
        <p>Because man is
        likely to be overinfluenced by face-to-face impressions that by
        definition involve his active participation, a job candidate who is a
        marvelous “pre-senter” often causes great danger under modern
        execu-tive-search practice. In my opinion, Hewlett-Packard faced just
        such a danger when it interviewed the articulate, dynamic Carly Fiorina
        in its search for a new CEO. And I believe that Hewlett-Packard made a
        bad decision when it chose Ms. Fiorina, and that this bad decision
        would not have been made if Hewlett-Packard had taken the
        methodological precautions it would have taken if it knew more
        psychology.</p>
        <p>
        There is a famous passage somewhere in Tolstoy that illuminates the
        power of Excessive Self-Regard Tendency. According to Tolstoy, the
        worst criminals don’t appraise themselves as all that bad. They come to
        believe either (1) that they didn’t commit their crimes or</p>
        <p>
        (2) that, considering the pressures and disadvantages of their lives,
        it is understandable and forgivable that they behaved as they did and
        became what they became.</p>
        <p>
        The second half of the “Tolstoy effect,” where the man makes excuses
        for his fixable poor performance, instead of providing the fix, is
        enormously important. Because a majority of mankind will try to get
        along by making way too many unreasonable excuses for fixable poor
        performance, it is very important to have personal and institutional
        <b>antidotes</b> limiting the ravages of such folly. On the personal
        level a man should try to face the two simple facts:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>fixable but
                unfixed bad performance is bad charac-ter and tends to create
                more of itself, causing more damage to the excuse giver with
                each tolerated in-stance, and</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>in
                demanding places, like athletic teams and General Electric, you
                are almost sure to be dis-carded in due course if you keep
                giving excuses in-</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>stead of behaving as
        you should.</p>
        <p>The main
        institutional <b>antidotes</b> to this part of the “Tolstoy effect”
        are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>a fair,
                meritocratic, demanding culture plus person-nel handling
                methods that build up morale, and</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>severance of
                the worst offenders.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Of course, when you
        can’t sever – as in the case of your own child – you must try to fix
        the child as best you can. I once heard of child- teaching method so
        effective that the child remembered the learning experience over fifty
        years later. The child later became Dean of the USC School of Music and
        then related to me what father said when he saw his child taking candy
        from the stock of his employer with the excuse that he intended to
        replace it later. The father said, “Son, it would be better for you to
        simply take all you want and call yourself a thief every time you do
        it.”</p>
        <p>The
        best <b>antidote</b> to folly from an excess of self-regard is to force
        yourself to be more objective when you are thinking about yourself,
        your family and friends, your property, and the value of your past and
        future activity. This isn’t easy to do well won’t work perfectly, but
        it will work much better than simply letting psycho-logical nature take
        its normal course.</p>
        <p>
        While an excess of self-regard is
        often counterpro-ductive in its effects on cognition, it can cause some
        weird successes from overconfidence that happens to cause success. This
        factor accounts for the adage: “Never underestimate the man who
        overestimates him-self.”</p>
        <p>Of course, some high
        self-appraisals are correct and serve better than false modesty.
        Moreover, self-regard in the form of a justified pride in a job well
        done, or a life well lived, is a large constructive force. Without such
        justified pride, many more airplanes would crash. “Pride” is another
        word generally left out of psychology textbooks, and this omission is
        not a good idea. It is also not a good idea to construe the bible’s
        parable about the Pharisee and the Publican as condemning all
        pride.</p>
        <p>Of
        all forms of useful pride, perhaps the most de-sirable is a justified
        pride in being trustworthy. More-over, the trustworthy man, even after
        allowing for the inconveniences of his chosen course, ordinarily has a
        life that averages out better than he would have if he pro-vided less
        reliability.</p>
        <h3>13. Overoptimism Tendency</h3>
        <p>About three centuries
        before the birth of Christ, Demosthenes, the most famous Greek orator,
        said, “What a man wishes, that also will he believe.”</p>
        <p>Demosthenes, parsed
        out, was thus saying that man displays not only Simple, Pain-Avoiding
        Psychological Denial but also an excess of optimism even when he is
        already doing well.</p>
        <p>The Greek orator was
        clearly right about an excess of optimism being the normal human
        condition, even when pain or the threat of pain is absent. Witness
        happy people buying lottery tickets or believing that
        credit-furnishing, delivery-making grocery stores were going to
        displace a great many superefficient cash-and-carry su-permarkets.</p>
        <p>
        One standard <b>antidote</b> to foolish optimism is trained, habitual
        use of the simple probability math of Fermat and Pascal, taught in my
        youth to high school sophomores. The mental rules of thumb that
        evolution gives you to deal with risk are not adequate. They re-semble
        the dysfunctional golf grip you would have if you relied on a grip
        driven by evolution instead of golf les-sons.</p>
        <h3>14. Deprival Superreaction Tendency</h3>
        <p>The quantity of man’s pleasure from a ten dollar gain does not
        exactly match the quantity of his displeasure from a ten-dollar loss.
        That is, the loss seems to hurt much more than the gain seems to help.
        Moreover, if a man almost gets something he greatly wants and has it
        jerked away from him at the last moment, he will react much as if he
        had long owned the reward and had it jerked away. I include the natural
        human reactions to both kind of loss experience – the loss of the
        possessed reward and the loss of the almost-possessed reward – under
        one description, Deprival Superreaction Tendency.</p>
        <p>In displaying
        Deprival Superreaction Tendency, man frequently incurs disadvantage by
        misframing his problems. He will often compare what is near instead of
        what really matters. For instance, a man with $10 million in his
        brokerage account will often be extremely irritated by the accidental
        loss of $100 out of the $300 in his wal-let.</p>
        <p>
        The Mungers once owned a tame and good-natured dog that displayed the
        canine version of Deprival Super-reaction Tendency. There was only one
        way to get bitten by this dog. And that was to try and take some food
        away from him after he already had it in his mouth. If you did that,
        this friendly dog would automatically bite. He couldn’t help it.
        Nothing could be more stupid than for the dog to bite his master. But
        the dog couldn’t help being foolish. He had an automatic Deprival
        Superreac-tion Tendency in his nature.</p>
        <p>
        Humans are much the same as this Munger dog. A man ordinarily reacts
        with irrational intensity to even a small loss, or threatened loss, of
        property, love, friend-ship, dominated territory, opportunity: status,
        or any other valued thing. As a natural result, bureaucratic
        in-fighting over the threatened loss of dominated territory often
        causes immense damage to an institution as a whole. This factor among
        others, accounts for much of the wisdom of Jack Welch’s long fight
        against bureau-cratic ills at General Electric. Few business leaders
        have ever conducted wiser campaigns.</p>
        <p>
        Deprival Superreaction Tendency often protects ideological or religious
        views by triggering and hatred directed toward vocal nonbelievers. This
        happens, in part, because the ideas of the nonbelievers, if they
        spread, will diminish the influence of views that are now supported by
        a comfortable environment including a strong relief-maintenance system.
        University liberal arts departments, law schools, and business
        organizations all display plenty of such ideology-based groupthink that
        rejects almost all conflicting inputs. When the vocal critic is a
        former believer, hostility is often boosted both by:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>a concept of
                betrayal that triggers additional De-prival Superreaction
                Tendency because a colleague is lost, and</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>fears that
                conflicting views will have extra persua-sive power when they
                come from a former col-</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>league.</p>
        <p>The foregoing
        considerations help account for the old idea of heresy, which for
        centuries justified much killing of heretics, frequently after torture
        and frequently ac-complished by burning the victim alive.</p>
        <p>
        It is almost everywhere the case that extremes of ideology are
        maintained with great intensity and with great antipathy to
        non-believers, causing extremes of cognitive dysfunction. This happens,
        I believe, because two psychological tendencies are usually acting
        concur-rently toward this same sad result: Inconsistency-Avoidance
        Tendency, plus Deprival Superreaction Ten-dency.</p>
        <p>
        One <b>antidote</b> to intense,
        deliberate maintenance of groupthink is an extreme culture of courtesy,
        kept in place despite ideological differences, like the behavior of the
        justices now serving on the U.S. Supreme Court. Another antidote is to
        deliberately bring in able and ar-ticulate disbelievers of incumbent
        groupthink. Successful corrective measures to evil examples of
        groupthink maintenance have included actions like that of Derek Bok
        when, as president of Harvard, he started disap-proving tenure
        appointments proposed by ideologues at Harvard Law School.</p>
        <p>Even a one-degree
        loss from a 180-degree view will sometime create enough Deprival
        Superreaction Ten-dency to turn a neighbor into an enemy, as I once
        ob-served when I bought a house from one of two neighbors locked into
        hatred by a tiny tree newly in-stalled by one of them.</p>
        <p>As the case of these
        two neighbors illustrated, the clamor of almost any group of neighbors
        displaying irrational, extreme deprival superreaction over some trifle
        in a zoning hearing is not a pretty thing to watch. Such bad behavior
        drives some people from the zoning field. I once bought some golf clubs
        from an artisan who was formerly a lawyer. When I asked him what kind
        of law he had practiced, I expected to hear him say, “di-vorce law” But
        his answer was, “zoning law.”</p>
        <p>
        Deprival Superreaction Tendency has ghastly ef-fects in labor
        relations. Most of the deaths in the labor strife that occurred before
        World War I came when em-ployers tried to reduce wages. Nowadays, we
        see fewer deaths and more occasions when whole companies dis-appear, as
        competition requires either takeaways from labor – which it will not
        consent to – or death of the business. Deprival Superreaction Tendency
        causes much of this labor resistance, often in cases where it would be
        in labor’s interest to make a different decision.</p>
        <p>In
        contexts other than labor relations, takeaways are also difficult to
        get. Many tragedies, therefore, occur that would have been avoided had
        there been more rational-ity and less subconscious heed of the
        imperative from Deprival Superreaction Tendency.</p>
        <p>Deprival
        Superreaction Tendency and Inconsis-tency-Avoidance Tendency often join
        to cause one form of business failure. In this form of ruin, a man
        gradually uses up all his good assets in a fruitless attempt to rescue
        a big venture going bad. One of the best <b>antidotes</b> to this folly
        is good poker skill learned young. The teaching value of poker
        demonstrates that not all effective teach-ing occurs on a standard
        academic path.</p>
        <p>
        Deprival Superreaction Tendency is also a huge contributor to ruin from
        compulsion to gamble. First, it causes the gambler to have a passion to
        get even once he has suffered loss, and the passion grows with the
        loss. Second, the most addictive forms of gambling provide a lot of
        near misses and each one triggers Deprival Super-reaction Tendency.
        Some slot machine creators are vi-cious in exploiting this weakness of
        man. Electronic machines enable these creators to produce a lot of
        meaningless bar-bar-lemon results that greatly increase play by fools
        who think they have very nearly won large rewards.</p>
        <p>
        Deprival Superreaction Tendency often does much damage to man in
        open-outcry auctions. The “social proof’ that we will next consider
        tends to convince man that the last price from another bidder was
        reasonable, and then Deprival Superreaction Tendency prompts him
        strongly to top the last bid. The best <b>antidote</b> to being thus
        triggered into paying foolish prices at open-outcry auctions is the
        simple Buffett practice: Don’t go to such auctions.</p>
        <p>I
        myself, the would-be instructor here, many dec-ades ago made a big
        mistake caused in part by subcon-scious operation of my Deprival
        Superreaction Ten-dency. A friendly broker called and offered me 300
        shares of ridiculously underpriced, very thinly traded Belridge Oil at
        $115 per share, which I purchased using cash I had on hand. The next
        day, he offered me 1,500 more shares at the same price, which I
        declined to buy, partly because I could only have made the purchase had
        I sold something or borrowed the required $173,000. This was a very
        irrational decision. I was a well-to-do man with no debt; there was no
        risk of loss; and similar no risk opportunities were not likely to come
        along. Within two years, Belridge Oil sold out to Shell at a price of
        about $3,700 per share, which made me about $5.4 million poorer than I
        would have been had I then been psychologically acute. As this tale
        demonstrates, psychological ignorance can be very expensive.</p>
        <p>Some people may
        question my defining Deprival Superreaction Tendency to include
        reaction to profit barely missed, as in the well-documented responses
        of slot machine players. However, I believe that I haven’t defined the
        tendency as broadly as I should. My reason for suggesting an even
        broader definition is that many Berkshire Hathaway shareholders I know
        never sell or give away a single share after immense gains in market
        value have occurred. Some of this reaction is caused by rational
        calculation, and some is, no doubt, attributable to some combination of
        (1) reward superresponse, (2) “status quo bias” from
        Inconsistency-Avoidance Ten-dency, and (3) “the endowment effect” from
        Excessive Self-Regard Tendency. But I believe the single strongest
        irrational explanation is a form of Deprival Superreac-tion Tendency.
        Many of these shareholders simply can’t stand the idea of having their
        Berkshire Hathaway hold-ings smaller. Partly they dislike facing what
        they consider an impairment of identity, but mostly they fear missing
        out on future gains from stock sold or given away.</p>
        <h3>15. Social-Proof Tendency</h3>
        <p>The otherwise complex behavior of
        man is much simpli-fied when he automatically thinks and does what he
        observes to be thought and done around him. And such followership often
        works fine. For instance, what simpler way could there be to find out
        how to walk to a big football game in a strange city than by following
        the flow of the crowd. For some such reason, man’s evolu-tion left him
        with Social-Proof Tendency, an automatic tendency to think and act as
        he sees others around him thinking and acting.</p>
        <p>
        Psychology professors love Social-Proof Tendency because in their
        experiments it causes ridiculous results. For instance, if a professor
        arranges for some stranger to enter an elevator wherein ten “compliance
        practitioners” are all silently standing so that they face the rear of
        the elevator, the stranger will often turn around and do the same. The
        psychology professors can also use Social-Proof Tendency to cause
        people to make large and ri-diculous measurement errors.</p>
        <p>And, of course,
        teenagers’ parents usually learn more than they would like about
        teenagers’ cognitive errors from Social-Proof Tendency. This phenomenon
        was recently involved in a breakthrough by Judith Rich Harris who
        demonstrated that superrespect by young people for their peers, rather
        than for parents or other adults, is ordained to some considerable
        extent by the genes of the young people. This makes it wise for
        par-ents to rely more on manipulating the quality of the peers than on
        exhortations to their own offspring. A person like Ms. Harris, who can
        provide an insight of this quality and utility, backed by new reasons,
        has not lived in vain.</p>
        <p>
        And in the highest reaches of business, it is not all uncommon to find
        leaders who display followership akin to that of teenagers. If one oil
        company foolishly buys a mine, other oil companies often quickly join
        in buying mines. So also if the purchased company makes fertilizer.
        Both of these oil company buying fads actually bloomed, with bad
        results.</p>
        <p>Of course, it is
        difficult to identify and correctly weigh all the possible ways to
        deploy the cash flow of an oil company. So oil company executives, like
        everyone else, have made many bad decisions that were quickly triggered
        by discomfort from doubt. Going along with social proof provided by the
        action of other oil compa-nies ends this discomfort in a natural
        way.</p>
        <p>
        When will Social-Proof Tendency be most easily triggered? Here the
        answer is clear from many experi-ments: Triggering most readily occurs
        in the presence of puzzlement or stress, and particularly when both
        exist.</p>
        <p>Because stress
        intensifies Social-Proof Tendency, disreputable sales organizations,
        engaged, for instance, in such action as selling swampland to
        schoolteachers, manipulate targets into situations combining isolation
        and stress. The isolation strengthens the social proof provided by both
        the knaves and the people who buy first, and the stress, often
        increased by fatigue, augments the targets’ susceptibility to the
        social proof. And, of course, the techniques of our worst “religious”
        cults imitate those of the knavish salesmen. One cult even used
        rattlesnakes to heighten the stress felt by conversion targets.</p>
        <p>Because both bad and
        good behavior are made con-tagious by Social-Proof Tendency, it is
        highly important that human societies stop any bad behavior before it
        spreads and foster and display all good behavior.</p>
        <p>My father once told
        me that just after commencing law practice in Omaha, he went with a
        large group from Nebraska to South Dakota to hunt pheasants. A South
        Dakota hunting license was, say, $2 for South Dakota residents and $5
        for nonresidents. All the Nebraska resi-dents, one by one, signed up
        for South Dakota licenses with phony South Dakota addresses until it
        was my fa-ther’s turn. Then, according to him, he barely prevented
        himself from doing what the others were doing, which was some sort of
        criminal offense.</p>
        <p>
        Not everyone so resists the social contagion of bad behavior. And,
        therefore, we often get “Serpico Syn-drome,” named to commemorate the
        state of a near-totally corrupt New York police division joined by
        Frank Serpico. He was then nearly murdered by gunfire because of his
        resistance to going along with the corrup-tion in the division. Such
        corruption was being driven by social proof plus incentives, the
        combination that cre-ates Serpico Syndrome. The Serpico story should be
        taught more than it now is because the didactic power of its horror is
        aimed at a very important evil, driven sub-stantially by a very
        important force: social proof.</p>
        <p>In social proof, it
        is not only action by others that misleads but also their inaction. In
        the presence of doubt, inaction by others becomes social proof that
        inaction is the right course. Thus, the inaction of a great many
        bystanders led to the death of Kitty Genovese in a famous incident much
        discussed in introductory psy-chology courses.</p>
        <p>In
        the ambit of social proof, the outside rectors on a corporate board
        usually display the near ultimate form of inaction. They fail to object
        to anything much short of an axe murder until some public embarrassment
        of the board finally causes their intervention. A typical
        board-of-directors’ culture was once well described by my friend, Joe
        Rosenfield, as he said, “They asked me if I wanted become a director of
        Northwest Bell, and it was the last thing they ever asked me.”</p>
        <p>In advertising and
        sales promotion, Social-Proof Tendency is about as strong a factor as
        one could imag-ine. “Monkey-see, monkey-do” is the old phrase that
        reminds one of how strongly John will often wish to do something, or
        have something, just because Joe does or has it. One interesting
        consequence is that an advertiser will pay a lot to have its soup can,
        instead of someone else’s, in a movie scene involving soup consumption
        only in a peripheral way.</p>
        <p>
        Social-Proof Tendency often interacts
        in a perverse way with Envy/Jealousy and Deprival Superreaction
        Tendency. One such interaction amused my family for years as people
        recalled the time when my cousin Russ and I, at ages three and four,
        fought and howled over a single surplus shingle while surrounded by a
        virtual sea of surplus shingles.</p>
        <p>
        But the adult versions of this occasion, boosted by psychological
        tendencies preserving ideologies, are not funny – and can bring down
        whole civilizations. The Middle East now presents just such a threat.
        By now the resources spent by Jews, Arabs and all others over a small
        amount of disputed land if divided arbitrarily among land claimants,
        would have made everyone better off, even before taking into account
        any benefit from reduced threat of war, possibly nuclear.</p>
        <p>Outside domestic
        relations it is rare now to try to resolve disputes by techniques
        including discussion of impacts from psychological tendencies.
        Considering the implications of childishness that would be raised by
        such inclusion, and the defects of psychology as now taught, this
        result may be sound. But, given the nuclear stakes now involved and the
        many failures in important nego-tiations lasting decades, I often
        wonder if some day, in some way, more use of psychological insight will
        even-tually improve outcomes. If so, correct teaching of psy-chology
        matters a lot. And, if old psychology professors are even less likely
        than old physics professors to learn new ways, which seems nearly
        certain, then we may, as Max Planck predicted, need a new generation of
        psy-chology professors who have grown up to think in a different
        way.</p>
        <p>If
        only one lesson is to be chosen from a package of lessons involving
        Social-Proof Tendency, and used in self improvement, my favorite would
        be: Learn how to ignore the examples from others when they are wrong,
        because few skills are more worth having.</p>
        <h3>16. Contrast-Misreaction Tendency</h3>
        <p>Because the nervous system of man does not naturally measure in
        absolute scientific units, it must instead rely on something simpler.
        The eyes have a solution that limits their programming needs: the
        contrast in what is seen is registered. And as in sight, so does it go,
        largely, in the other senses. Moreover, as perception goes, so goes
        cognition. The result is man’s Contrast-Misreaction Tendency. Few
        psychological tendencies do more dam-age to correct thinking.
        Small-scale damages involve instances such as man’s buying an
        overpriced $1,000 leather dashboard merely because the price is so low
        compared to his concurrent purchase of a $65,000 car. Large-scale
        damages often ruin lives, as when a wonder-ful woman having terrible
        parents marries a man who would be judged satisfactory only in
        comparison to her parents. Or as when a man takes wife number two who
        would be appraised as all right only in comparison to wife number
        one.</p>
        <p>A
        particularly reprehensible form of sales practice occurs in the offices
        of some real estate brokers. A buyer from out of the city, perhaps
        needing to shift his family there, visits the office with little time
        available. The salesman deliberately shows the customer three awful
        houses at ridiculously high prices. Then he shows him a merely bad
        house at a price only moderately too high. And, boom, the broker often
        makes an easy sale.</p>
        <p>Contrast-Misreaction
        Tendency is routinely used to cause disadvantage for customers buying
        merchandise and services. To make an ordinary price seem low, the
        vendor will very frequently create a highly artificial price that is
        much higher than the price always sought, then advertise his standard
        price as a big reduction from his phony price. Even when people know
        that this sort of customer manipulation is being attempted, it will
        often work to trigger buying. This phenomenon accounts in part for much
        advertising in newspapers. It also demon-strates that being aware of
        psychological ploys is not a perfect defense. When a man’s steps are
        consecutively taken toward disaster, with each step being very small,
        the brain’s Contrast-Misreaction Tendency will often let the man go too
        far toward disaster to be able to avoid it. This happens because each
        step presents small a con-trast from his present position.</p>
        <p>A
        bridge-playing pal of mine once told me that a frog tossed into very
        hot water would jump out, but that the same frog would end up dying if
        placed in room-temperature water that was later treated at a very slow
        rate. My few shreds of physiological knowledge make me doubt this
        account. But no matter, because many businesses die in just the manner
        claimed by my friend for the frog. Cognition, misled by tiny changes
        involving low contrast, will often miss a trend that is destiny.</p>
        <p>
        One of Ben Franklin’s best-remembered and most useful aphorisms is “A
        small leak will sink great ship.” The utility of the aphorism is large
        precisely because the brain so often misses the functional equivalent
        of a small leak in a great ship.</p>
        <h3>17. Stress-Influence Tendency</h3>
        <p>Everyone recognizes
        that sudden stress, for instance from a threat, will cause a rush of
        adrenaline in the hu-man body, prompting faster and more extreme
        reaction. And everyone who has taken Psych 101 knows that stress makes
        Social-Proof Tendency more powerful.</p>
        <p>In
        a phenomenon less well recognized, but still widely known, light stress
        can slightly improve perform-ance – say, in examinations – whereas
        heavy stress causes dysfunction.</p>
        <p>
        But few people know more about really heavy stress than that it can
        cause depression. For instance, most people know that an “acute stress
        depression” makes thinking dysfunctional because it causes an extreme
        of pessimism, often extended in length and usually accom-panied by
        activity stopping fatigue. Fortunately, as most people also know, such
        a depression is one of mankind’s more reversible ailments. Even before
        modern drugs were available, many people afflicted by depression, such
        as Winston Churchill and Samuel Johnson, gained great achievement in
        life.</p>
        <p> Most people know very little about nondepressivemental
        breakdowns influenced by heavy stress. But there is at least one
        exception, involving the work of Pavlov when he was in his seventies
        and eighties. Pavlov had won a Nobel Prize early in life by using dogs
        to work out the physiology of digestion. Then he became world-famous by
        working out mere-association responses in dogs, initially salivating
        dogs – so much so that changes in behavior triggered by
        mere-association, like those caused by much modern advertisement, are
        today often said to come from “Pavlovian” conditioning.</p>
        <p>What happened to
        cause Pavlov’s last work was especially interesting. During the great
        Leningrad Flood of the 1920s, Pavlov had many dogs in cages. Their
        hab-its had been transformed, by a combination of his “Pav-lovian
        conditioning” plus standard reward responses, into distinct and
        different patterns. As the waters of the flood came up and receded,
        many dogs reached a point where they had almost no airspace between
        their noses and the tops of their cages. This subjected them to maximum
        stress. Immediately thereafter, Pavlov noticed that many of the dogs
        were no longer behaving as they had. For example, the dog that formerly
        had liked his trainer now disliked him. This result reminds one of
        modern cognition-reversals in which a person’s love of his parents
        suddenly becomes hate, as new love has been shifted suddenly to a cult.
        The unanticipated, extreme changes in Pavlov’s dogs would have driven
        any good experimental scientist into a near-frenzy of curiosity. That
        was indeed Pavlov’s reaction. But not many scien-tists would have done
        what Pavlov next did.</p>
        <p>
        And that was to spend the rest of his long life giv-ing stress-induced
        nervous breakdowns to dogs, after which he would try to reverse the
        breakdowns, all the while keeping careful experimental records. He
        found</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>that he could
                classify dogs so as to predict how easily a particular dog
                would breakdown;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>that the dogs
                hardest to break down were also the hardest to return to their
                pre-breakdown state;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>that any dog could be broken down; and</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>that he
                couldn’t reverse a breakdown except by</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>reimposing
        stress.</p>
        <p>Now, practically everyone is revolted by such experi-mental
        treatment of man’s friend, the dog. Moreover, Pavlov was Russian and
        did his last work under the Communists. And maybe those facts account
        for the present extreme, widespread ignorance of Pavlov’s last work.
        The two Freudian psychiatrists with whom I tried many years ago to
        discuss this work had never heard of it. And the dean of a major
        medical school actually asked me, several years ago, if any of Pavlov’s
        experi-ments were “repeatable” in experiments of other re-searchers.
        Obviously, Pavlov is now a sort of forgotten hero in medical
        science.</p>
        <p>I first found a
        description of Pavlov’s last work in a popular paperback, written by
        some Rockefeller-financed psychiatrist, when I was trying to figure out
        how cults worked their horrible mischief and what should the law say
        about what parents could do to “de-program” children who had become
        brainwashed zom-bies. Naturally, mainstream law objected to the zombies
        being physically captured by their parents and subjected to stress that
        would help to deprogram the effects of the stress they had endured in
        cult conversions.</p>
        <p>I
        never wanted to get into the legal controversy that existed about this
        subject. But I did conclude that the controversy couldn’t be handled
        with maximized ration-ality without considering whether as Pavlov’s
        last work suggests, the heavy -handed imposition of stress might be the
        only reversal method that would work to remedy one of the worst evils
        imaginable: a stolen mind. I have included this discussion of Pavlov
        partly out of general antagonism toward taboos, partly to make my talk
        rea-sonably complete as it considers stress and partly be-cause I hope
        some listener may continue my inquiry with more success.</p>
        <h3>18. Availability-Misweighing Tendency</h3>
        <p>This mental tendency echoes the words of the song: “When I’m not
        near the girl I love, I love the girl I’m near.” Man’s imperfect,
        limited-capacity brain easily drifts into working with what’s easily
        available to it. And the brain can’t use what it can’t remember or what
        it is blocked from recognizing because it is heavily influ-enced by one
        or more psychological tendencies bearing strongly on it, as the fellow
        is influenced by the nearby girl in the song. And so the mind
        overweighs what is easily available and thus displays
        Availability-Misweighing Tendency.</p>
        <p>
        The main <b>antidotes</b> to miscues from Availability-Misweighing
        Tendency often involve procedures, in-cluding use of checklists, which
        are almost always help-ful.</p>
        <p>
        Another <b>antidote</b> is to behave somewhat like Dar-win did when he
        emphasized disconfirming evidence. What should be done is to especially
        emphasize factors that don’t produce reams of easily available numbers,
        instead of drifting mostly or entirely into considering factors that do
        produce such numbers. Still another an-tidote is to find and hire some
        skeptical, articulate peo-ple with far-reaching minds to act as
        advocates for no-tions that are opposite to the incumbent notions.</p>
        <p>
        One consequence of this tendency is that extra vivid evidence, being so
        memorable and thus more available in cognition, should often
        consciously be un-derweighed while less vivid evidence should be
        over-weighed.</p>
        <p>
        Still, the special strength of extra-vivid images in influencing the
        mind can be constructively used</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>in persuading
                someone else to reach a correct con-clusion or</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>as a device for
                improving one’s own memory by attaching vivid images, one after
                the other, to many</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>items one doesn’t
        want to forget.</p>
        <p> Indeed, such use of vivid images as memory boosters is
        what enabled the great orators of classical Greece and Rome to give
        such long, organized speeches without using notes.</p>
        <p>
        The great algorithm to remember in dealing with this tendency is
        simple: An idea or a fact is not worth more merely because it is easily
        available to you.</p>
        <h3>19. Use-It-or-Lose-It Tendency</h3>
        <p>All skills attenuate with disuse. I was a whiz at calculus until age
        twenty, after which the skill was soon obliter-ated by total nonuse.
        The right antidote to such a loss is to make use of the functional
        equivalent of the aircraft simulator employed in pilot training. This
        allows a pilot to continuously practice all of the rarely used skills
        that he can’t afford to lose.</p>
        <p>
        Throughout his life, a wise man engages in practice of all his useful,
        rarely used skills, many of them outside his discipline, as a sort of
        duty to his better self. If he reduces the number of skills he
        practices and, therefore, the number of skills he retains, he will
        naturally drift into error from man with a hammer tendency. His
        learning capacity will also shrink as he creates gaps in the
        lattice-work of theory he needs as a framework for understand-ing new
        experience. It is also essential for a thinking man to assemble his
        skills into a checklist that he rou-tinely uses. Any other mode of
        operation will cause him to miss much that is important.</p>
        <p>
        Skills of a very high order can be maintained only with daily practice.
        The pianist Paderewski once said that if he failed to practice for a
        single day, he could notice his performance deterioration and that,
        after a week’s gap in practice, the audience could notice it as
        well.</p>
        <p>
        The hard rule of Use-It-or-Lose -It Tendency tem-pers its harshness for
        the diligent. If a skill is raised to fluency, instead of merely being
        crammed in briefly to enable one to pass some test, then the skill (1)
        will be lost more slowly and (2) will come back faster when refreshed
        with new learning. These are not minor advan-tages, and a wise man
        engaged in learning some impor-tant skill will not stop until he is
        really fluent in it.</p>
        <h3>20. Drug-Misinfluence Tendency</h3>
        <p>This tendency’s
        destructive power is so widely known to be intense, with frequent
        tragic consequences for cogni-tion and the outcome of life, that it
        needs no discussion here to supplement that previously given under
        “Simple, Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial.”</p>
        <h3>21. Senescence-Misinfluence Tendency</h3>
        <p>With advanced age, there comes a natural cognitive de-cay, differing
        among individuals in the earliness of its arrival and the speed of its
        progression. Practically no one is good at learning complex new skills
        when very old. But some people remain pretty good in maintaining
        intensely practiced old skills until late in life, as one can notice in
        many a bridge tournament.</p>
        <p>Old people like me get pretty skilled, without work-ing at it, at
        disguising age-related deterioration because social convention, like
        clothing, hides much decline.</p>
        <p>Continuous thinking
        and learning, done with joy, can somewhat help delay what is
        inevitable.</p>
        <h3>22. Authority-Misinfluence Tendency</h3>
        <p>Living in dominance hierarchies as he does, like all his ancestors
        before him, man was born mostly to follow leaders, with only a few
        people doing the leading. And so, human society is formally organized
        into dominance hierarchies, with their culture augmenting the natural
        follow-the-leader tendency of man.</p>
        <p>But automatic as
        most human reactions are, with the tendency to follow leaders being no
        exception, man is often destined to suffer greatly when the leader is
        wrong or when his leader’s ideas don’t get through properly in the
        bustle of life and are misunderstood. And so, we find much miscognition
        from man’s Author-ity-Misinfluence Tendency.</p>
        <p>
        Some of the misinfluences are amusing, as in a case described by
        Cialdini. A physician left a written order for a nurse treating an
        earache, as follows: “Two drops, twice a day, r. ear.” The nurse then
        directed the patient to turn over and put the eardrops in his anus.</p>
        <p>Other versions of
        confused instructions from au-thority figures are tragic. In World War
        II, a new pilot for a general, who sat beside him in the copilot’s
        seat, was so anxious to please his boss that he misinterpreted some
        minor shift in the general’s position as a direction to do some foolish
        thing. The pilot crashed the plane and became a paraplegic.</p>
        <p>
        Well, naturally, cases like this one get the attention of careful
        thinkers like Boss Buffett, who always acts like an overquiet mouse
        around his pilots.</p>
        <p>Such cases are also
        given attention in the simulator training of copilots who have to learn
        to ignore certain really foolish orders from boss pilots because boss
        pilots will sometimes err disastrously. Even after going through such a
        training regime, however, copilots in simulator exercises will too
        often allow the simulated plane to crash because of some extreme and
        perfectly obvious simulated error of the chief pilot.</p>
        <p> After Corporal Hitler had risen to dominate Ger-many,
        leading a bunch of believing Lutherans and Catholics into orgies of
        genocide and other mass de-struction, one clever psychology professor,
        Stanley Mil-gram, decided to do an experiment to determine exactly how
        far authority figures could lead ordinary people into gross
        misbehavior. In this experiment, a man posing as an authority figure,
        namely a professor governing a re-spectable experiment, was able to
        trick a great many ordinary people into giving what they had every
        reason to believe were massive electric shocks that inflicted heavy
        torture on innocent fellow citizens. This experi-ment did demonstrate a
        terrible result contributed to by Authority-Misinfluence Tendency, but
        it also demonstrated extreme ignorance in the psychology professori-ate
        right after World War II.</p>
        <p>Almost any
        intelligent person with my checklist of psychological tendencies in his
        hand would, by simply going down the checklist, have seen that
        Milgram’s ex-periment involved about six powerful psychological
        tendencies acting in confluence to bring about his ex-treme
        experimental result. For instance, the person pushing Milgram’s shock
        lever was given much social proof from presence of inactive bystanders
        whose si-lence communicated that his behavior was okay. Yet it took
        over a thousand psychological papers, published before I got to
        Milgram, for the professoriate to get his experiment only about ninety
        percent as well understood as it would have immediately been by any
        intelligent person who used (1) any sensible organization of
        psy-chology along the lines of this talk, plus (2) a checklist
        procedure. This outcome displaying the dysfunctional thinking of
        long-dead professors deserves a better ex-planation. I will later deal
        with the subject in a very hesi-tant fashion.</p>
        <p>We can be pleased
        that the psychology professori-ate of a former era wasn’t quite as
        dysfunctional as the angler in my next-to-last illustration of
        Authority-Misinfluence Tendency.</p>
        <p>When I once fished
        in the Rio Colorado in Costa Rica, my guide, in a state of shock, told
        me a story about an angler who’d earlier come to the river without ever
        having fished for tarpon. A fishing guide like the one I had runs the
        boat and gives fishing advice, establishing himself in this context as
        the ultimate authority figure. In the case of this guide, his native
        language was Span-ish, while the angler’s native language was English.
        The angler got a big tarpon on and began submitting to many directions
        from this authority figure called guide: tip up, tip down, reel in,
        etc. Finally, when it was neces-sary to put more pressure on the fish
        by causing more bending of the angler’s rod, the guide said in English:
        “Give him the rod, give him the rod.” Well, the angler threw his
        expensive rod at the fish, and when last seen, it was going down the
        Rio Colorado toward the ocean. This example shows how powerful is the
        tendency to go along with an authority figure and how it can turn ones
        brain into mush.</p>
        <p>My
        final example comes from business. A psychol-ogy Ph.D. once became a
        CEO of a major company and went wild, creating an expensive
        headquarters, with a great wine cellar, at an isolated site. At some
        point, his underlings remonstrated that money was running short. “Take
        the money out of the depreciation reserves,” said the CEO. Not too easy
        because a depreciation reserve is a liability account.</p>
        <p>So
        strong is undue respect for authority that this CEO, and many even
        worse examples, have actually been allowed to remain in control of
        important business institutions for long periods after it was clear
        they should be removed. The obvious implication: be careful whom you
        appoint to power because a dominant au-thority figure will often be
        hard to remove, aided as he will be by Authority-Misinfluence
        Tendency.</p>
        <h3>23. Twaddle Tendency</h3>
        <p>Man, as a social animal
        who has the gift of language, is born to prattle and to pour out
        twaddle that does much damage when serious work is being attempted.
        Some people produce copious amounts of twaddle and others very
        little.</p>
        <p>A trouble from the
        honeybee version of twaddle once demonstrated in an interesting
        experiment. A hon-eybee normally goes out and finds nectar and then
        comes back and does a dance that communicates to the other bees where
        the nectar is. The other bees then go out and get it. Well some
        scientist – clever, like B. F. Skinner – decided to see how well a
        honeybee would do with a handicap. He put the nectar straight up. Way
        up. Well, in a natural setting, there is no nectar a long way straight
        up, and the poor honeybee doesn’t have a ge-netic program that is
        adequate to handle what she now as to communicate. You might guess that
        this honeybee would come back to the hive and slink into a corner, but
        she doesn’t. She comes into the hive and does an inco-herent dance.
        Well, all my life I’ve been dealing with the human equivalent of that
        honeybee. And it’s a very im-portant part of wise administration to
        keep prattling people, pouring out twaddle, far away from the serious
        work.</p>
        <p>A rightly famous
        Caltech engineering professor, exhibiting more insight than tact, once
        expressed his version of this idea as follows: “The principal job of an
        academic administration is to keep the people who don’t matter from
        interfering with the work of the people that do.” I include this
        quotation partly because I long suf-fered from backlash caused by my
        version of this pro-fessor’s conversational manner. After much effort,
        I was able to improve only slightly, so one of my reasons for supplying
        the quotation is my hope that, at least in com-parison, I will appear
        tactful.</p>
        <h3>24. Reason-Respecting Tendency</h3>
        <p>There is in man,
        particularly one in an advanced culture, a natural love of accurate
        cognition and a joy in its exer-cise. This accounts for the widespread
        popularity of crossword puzzles, other puzzles, and bridge and chess
        columns, as well as all games requiring mental skill.</p>
        <p>This tendency has an
        obvious implication. It makes man especially prone to learn well when a
        would-be teacher gives correct reasons for what is taught, instead of
        simply laying out the desired belief <i>ex cathedra</i> with no reasons
        given. Few practices, therefore, are wiser than not only thinking
        through reasons before giving orders but also communicating these
        reasons to the recipient of the order.</p>
        <p>No one knew this
        better than Carl Braun, who de-signed oil refineries with spectacular
        skill and integrity.</p>
        <p> He had a very simple rule, one of many in his large,
        Teu-tonic company: You had to tell Who was to do What, Where, When, and
        Why. And if you wrote a communi-cation leaving out your explanation of
        why the addressee was to do what was ordered, Braun was likely to fire
        you because Braun well knew that ideas got through best when reasons
        for the ideas were meticulously laid out.</p>
        <p>In general, learning
        is most easily assimilated and used when, life long, people
        consistently hang their ex-perience, actual and vicarious, on a
        latticework of theory answering the question: Why? Indeed, the question
        “Why?” is a sort of Rosetta stone opening up the major potentiality of
        mental life.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately,
        Reason-Respecting Tendency is so strong that even a person’s giving of
        meaningless or incorrect reasons will increase compliance with his
        or-ders and requests. This has been demonstrated in psy-chology
        experiments wherein “compliance practitioners” successfully jump to the
        head of the lines in front of copying machines by explaining their
        reason: “I have to make some copies.” This sort of unfortunate
        byproduct of Reason-Respecting Tendency is a conditioned reflex, based
        on a widespread appreciation of the importance of reasons. And,
        naturally, the practice of laying out various claptrap reasons is much
        used by commercial and cult “compliance practitioners” to help them get
        what they don’t deserve.</p>
        <p>
        <b>25. Lollapalooza Tendency –The Tendency to Get Extreme Consequences
        from Confluences of Psychological Tendencies Acting in Favor of a
        Particular Outcome</b></p>
        <p>This tendency was not in any of the psychology texts I once
        examined, at least in any coherent fashion, yet it dominates life. It
        accounts for the extreme result in the Milgram experiment and the
        extreme success of some cults that have stumbled through practice
        evolution into bringing pressure from many psychological tendencies to
        bear at the same time on conversion targets. The tar-gets vary in
        susceptibility, like the dogs Pavlov worked with in his old age, but
        some of the minds that are tar-geted simply snap into zombiedom under
        cult pressure. Indeed, that is one cult’s name for the conversion
        phe-nomenon: snapping.</p>
        <p>What are we to make
        of the extreme ignorance of the psychology textbook writers of
        yesteryear? How could anyone who had taken a freshman course in
        phys-ics or chemistry not be driven to consider, above all, how
        psychological tendencies combine and with what effects? Why would
        anyone think his study of psychol-ogy was adequate without his having
        endured the com-plexity involved in dealing with intertwined
        psychologi-cal tendencies? What could be more ironic than profes-sors
        using oversimplified notions while studying bad cognitive effects
        grounded in the mind’s tendency to use oversimplified algorithms?</p>
        <p>I will make a few
        tentative suggestions. Maybe many of the long-dead professors wanted to
        create a whole science from one narrow type of repeatable psy-chology
        experiment that was conductible in a university setting and that aimed
        at one psychological tendency at a time. If so, these early psychology
        professors made a massive error in so restricting their approach to
        their subject. It would be like physics ignoring astrophysics because
        it couldn’t happen in a physics lab, plus all compound effects. What
        psychological tendencies could account for early psychology professors
        adopting an over-restricted approach to their own subject matter? One
        candidate would be Availability-Misweighing Ten-dency grounded in a
        preference for easy-to-control data. And then the restrictions would
        eventually create an extreme case of man with a hammer tendency.
        Another candidate might be Envy/jealousy Tendency through which early
        psychology professors displayed some weird form of envy of a physics
        that was misunderstood. And this possibility tends to demonstrate that
        leaving envy/jealousy out of academic psychology was never a good idea.
        I now quit claim of all these historical myster-ies to my betters.</p>
        <p>Well, that ends my
        brief description of psychologi-cal tendencies.</p>
        <p><b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</b></p>
        <p>Now, as promised, I
        will ask and answer a few general questions.</p>
        <ol start="17">
            <li>
                <p>
                <b>Isn’t this list of psychological tendencies tauto-logical to
                some extent compared to the system of Euclid? That is, aren’t
                there overlaps in the tenden-cies? And couldn’t the system be
                laid out just as plausibly in a somewhat different way?</b></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The answers are yes,
        yes, and yes, but this matters only moderately. Further refinement of
        these tendencies, while desirable, has a limited practical potential
        because a significant amount of messiness is unfixable in a soft
        science like psychology.</p>
        <ol start="17">
            <li>
                <p>
                <b>Can you supply a real world model, instead of a Milgram-type
                controlled psychology experiment, that uses your system to
                illustrate multiple psycho-logical tendencies interacting in a
                plausibly diag-nosable way?</b></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The answer is yes. One of my
        favorite cases involves the McDonnell Douglas airliner evacuation test.
        Before a new airliner can be sold, the government requires that it pass
        an evacuation test, during which a full load of pas-sengers must get
        out in some short period of time. The government directs that the test
        be realistic. So you can’t pass by evacuating only twenty-year-old
        athletes. So McDonnell Douglas scheduled such a test in a darkened
        hangar using a lot of old people as evacuees. The pas-senger cabin was,
        say, twenty feet above the concrete floor of the hangar and was to be
        evacuated through moderately flimsy rubber chutes. The first test was
        made in the morning. There were about twenty very serious injuries, and
        the evacuation took so long it flunked the time test. So what did
        McDonnell Douglas next do? It repeated the test in the afternoon, and
        this time there was another failure, with about twenty more serious
        injuries, including one case of permanent paralysis.</p>
        <p>What psychological
        tendencies contributed to this terrible result? Well, using my,
        tendency list as a check-list, I come up with the following
        explanation. Reward-Superresponse Tendency drove McDonnell Douglas to
        act fast. It couldn’t sell its airliner until it passed the test. Also
        pushing the company was Doubt-Avoidance Ten-dency with its natural
        drive to arrive at a decision and run with it. Then the government’s
        direction that the test be realistic drove Authority-Misinfluence
        Tendency into the mischief of causing McDonnell Douglas to overreact by
        using what was obviously too dangerous a test method. By now the course
        of action had been de-cided, so Inconsistency Avoidance Tendency helped
        preserve the near idiotic plan. When all the old people got to the dark
        hangar, with its high airline cabin and concrete floor, the situation
        must have made McDonnell Douglas employees very queasy, but they saw
        other em-ployees and supervisors not objecting. Social Proof Tendency,
        therefore, swamped the queasiness. And this allowed continued action as
        planned, a continuation that was aided by more Authority Overinfluence
        Tendency. Then came the disaster of the morning test with its fail-ure,
        plus serious injuries. McDonnell Douglas ignored the strong
        disconfirming evidence from the failure of the first test because
        confirmation bias, aided by the triggering of strong Deprival
        Superreaction Tendency favored maintaining the original plan. McDonnell
        Doug-las’ Deprival Superreaction Tendency was now like that which
        causes a gambler, bent on getting even after a huge loss, to make his
        final big bet. After all, McDonnell Douglas was going to lose a lot if
        it didn’t pass its test as scheduled. More psychology-based explanation
        can probably be made, but the foregoing discussion is com-plete enough
        to demonstrate the utility of my system when used in a checklist
        mode.</p>
        <p>
        <b>Q. In the practical world, what good is the thought system laid out
        in this list of tendencies? Isn’t prac-tical benefit prevented because
        these psychological tendencies are so thoroughly programmed into the
        human mind by broad evolution [the combination of genetic and cultural
        evolution] that we can’t get rid of them?</b></p>
        <p>Well, the answer is that the tendencies are probably much more good
        than bad. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be there, working pretty well for
        man, given his condition and his limited brain capacity. So the
        tendencies can’t be simply washed out automatically, and shouldn’t be.
        Nev-ertheless, the psychological thought system described, when
        properly understood and used, enables the spread of wisdom and good
        conduct and facilitates the avoid-ance of disaster. Tendency is not
        always destiny, and knowing the tendencies and their antidotes can
        often help prevent trouble that would otherwise occur.</p>
        <p>
        Here is a short list of examples reminding us of the great utility of
        elementary psychological knowledge:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Carl Braun’s communication practices.</p>
            </li>

                <p>The use of simulators in pilot training.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The system of Alcoholics Anonymous.</p>
            </li>

                <p>The rules of the U.S. Constitutional Convention: totally
                secret meetings, no recorded vote by name until the final vote,
                votes reversible at any time be-fore the end of the convention,
                then just one vote on the whole Constitution. These are very
                clever psychology-respecting rules. If the founders had used a
                different procedure, many people would have been pushed by
                various psychological tenden-cies into inconsistent, hardened
                positions. The elite founders got our Constitution through by a
                whisker only because they were psychologically acute.</p>

                said, “They’re teaching twenty-eight year-old people that high
                school algebra works in real life?” But later, I wised up and
                realized that it was very important that they do that to
                counter some bad effects from psychological tendencies. Better

                corporations, if you make an acquisi-tion and it turns out to
                be a disaster, all the people, paperwork, and presentations
                that caused the fool-ish acquisition are quickly forgotten.
                Nobody wants to be associated with the poor outcome by
                men-tioning it. But at Johnson &amp; Johnson, the rules make
                everybody revisit old acquisitions, comparing predictions with
                outcomes. That is a very smart thing to do.</p>

        <p> <b>Q.What special knowledge problems lie buried in the
        thought system demonstrated by your list?</b></p>
        <p>
        Well, one answer is paradox. In social psychology, the more people
        learn about the system the less it is true, and this is what gives the
        system its great value as a pre-venter of bad outcomes and a driver of
        good outcomes. This result is paradoxical, and doesn’t remind one of
        elementary physics, but so what. One can’t get all the paradox out of
        pure math, so why should psychology be shocked by some paradox?</p>
        <p>
        There is also some paradox in cognition change that works even when the
        manipulated person knows he is being manipulated. This creates a sort
        of paradox in a paradox, but, again, so what. I once much enjoyed an
        occasion of this sort. I drew this beautiful woman as my dinner partner
        many years ago. I’d never seen her be-fore. She was married to a
        prominent Los Angeles man. She sat down next to me, turned her
        beautiful face up, and said, “Charlie, what one word accounts for your
        remarkable success in life?” I knew I was being manipu-lated by a
        practiced routine, and I just loved it. I never see this woman without
        a little lift in my spirits. And, by the way, I told her I was
        rational. You’ll have to judge yourself whether that’s true. I may be
        demonstrating some psychological tendency I hadn’t planned on
        dem-onstrating.</p>
        <ol start="17">
            <li>
                <p><b>Don’t we
                need more reconciliation of psychol-ogy and economics?</b></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        My answer is yes, and I suspect that some slight progress is being
        made. I have heard of one such example. Colin Camerer of Caltech, who
        works in “experimental eco-nomics,” devised an interesting experiment
        in which he caused high I.Q. students, playing for real money, to pay
        price A+B for a “security” they knew would turn into A dollars at the
        end of the day. This foolish action oc-curred because the students were
        allowed to trade with each other in liquid market for the security. And
        some students then paid price A+B because they hoped to unload on other
        students at a higher price before the day was over. What I will now
        confidently predict is that, despite Camerer’s experimental outcome,
        most econom-ics and corporate finance professors who still believe in
        the “hard-form efficient market hypothesis” will retain their original
        belief. If so, this will be one more indica-tion of how irrational
        smart people can be when influ-enced by psychological tendencies.</p>
        <ol start="17">
            <li>
                <p>
                <b>Don’t moral and prudential problems come with knowledge of
                these psychological tendencies?</b></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The answer is yes.
        For instance, psychological knowl-edge improves persuasive power and,
        like other power, it can be used for good or ill. Captain Cook once
        played a psychology-based trick on his seamen to cause them to eat
        sauerkraut and avoid scurvy. In my opinion, this action was both
        ethical and wise under the circum-stances, despite the deliberate
        manipulation involved.</p>
        <p>But ordinarily,
        when you try to use your knowledge of psychological tendencies in the
        artful manipulation of someone whose trust you need, you will be making
        both a moral and prudential error. The moral error is obvious. The
        prudential error comes because many intelligent people, targeted for
        conscious manipulation, are likely to figure out what you are trying to
        do and resent your action.</p>
        <p><b>Q. Aren’t there
        factual and reasoning errors in this talk?</b></p>
        <p>The answer is yes,
        almost surely yes. The final revision was made from memory over about
        fifty hours by a man eighty-one years old, who never took a course in
        psy-chology and has read none of it, except one book on developmental
        psychology, for nearly fifteen years. Even so. I think the totality of
        my talk will stand up very well, and I hope all my descendants and
        friends will carefully consider what I have said. I even hope that more
        psy-chology professors will join me in:</p>

            <li>
                <p>especially

                tendencies.</p>

        </ol>
        <p>Well that ends my talk.
